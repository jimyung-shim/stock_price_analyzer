2006-12-04,Hedge Funds Face Pressure To Reform,0.06041666666666665,"Hedge funds are heading into a rough few weeks. Many funds are looking at some pretty average returns this year--and if that's not bad enough--the industry faces U.S. Congressional hearings starting tomorrow on regulations and insider trading.William Galvin is Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Tom Curran is a securities lawyer and partner with Ganfer and Shore. Both men appeared on ""Street Signs"" and have different opinions on what needs--or doesn't need--to be done with hedge funds.Galvin says hedge funds are marketed to people who shouldn't be investing in them. And he says there should be minimum investments and the funds should be registered. He said there needs to be total transparency when it comes to hedge funds.Curran is completely on the other side--saying there is no need for minimum investments. He said Congress should proceed cautiously on hedge funds--considering the role they play in the U.S. economy. He said there are a lot of myths when it comes to hedge funds--and that the criticism is over blown. FYI: There are some 9,228 hedge funds with nearly $1.3 trillion dollars invested in them."
2006-12-26,U.S. Treasurys Higher in Reversal of Sell-Off,0.07840195105820105,"U.S. Treasurys prices were modestly higher in extremely quiet trading, in a partial reversal of Friday's sell-off.With very little economic data to speak of, ""activity is somewhat subdued"" and ""liquidity is definitely impaired,"" said Jason Evans, head of government trading for Deutsche Bank.The price of the Treasury's 10-year note was up around midday, while its yield fell from Friday's level, when trading desks closed early ahead of the Christmas holiday. Prices and yields move in opposite directions.A manufacturing and economic activity report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond released Tuesday morning came in at negative 6 versus November's 7. However, the data failed to move the market in any noticeable way.The real surprise in the market was Friday's sell-off, Evans said. Friday's data _ and in particular the core personal consumption expenditures price index, a key measure of inflation _ were on the tamer side. Compared with a year earlier, the core PCE price index rose 2.2% in November from a year earlier, down from a 2.4% year-over-year climb in October.However, despite what should have been bond-friendly data, the Treasurys market sold off heavily, largely on profit-taking.The sell-off Friday ""occurred on relatively light volume,"" Evans said, ""and the market is ... in recovery.""Hedge funds were in the market buying 10-year Treasurys Tuesday, with good buying by money managers in five-year Treasurys as well, according to RBS Greenwich Capital.As for the remainder of the week, ""we are rather neutral,"" RBS Greenwich noted in market commentary."
2006-12-27,Dollar Down but Pares Losses,0.05378320239431351,"The dollar was largely down against other major currencies, although a surprisingly strong rise in new home sales helped the dollar reverse some of its losses.The government reported that new home sales beat expectations and rose 3.4 percent in November to an annual pace of 1.047 million units, which eased concerns about the extent of the housing market's slowdown and tempered expectations that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates early next year to stimulate growth.""The new home sales report did beat the consensus forecast, and that, I think, provides further evidence to support the view that the worst of the housing downturn may have passed,"" said Alex Beuzelin, senior market analyst for Ruesch International in Washington, D.C.With the European Central Bank widely expected to keep raising rates and the Bank of Japan possibly discussing tighter monetary policy at its meeting in January, the dollar slipped as investors returned from the Christmas holiday with more conviction that the U.S. currency's yield advantage will fade next year.Data showing weaker-than-expected Japan retail sales was overshadowed by a media report that the Bank of Japan will probably discuss raising interest rates at next month's policy meeting.Currency trading in Asia was disrupted after strong earthquakes near Taiwan damaged undersea telecommunications cables, restricting international telephone traffic and Internet speeds, but trade in the North American markets was not affected.U.S. benchmark Treasury note prices, meanwhile, were off almost a full point on the day at 99 27/32, bringing yields up to 4.64%, taking their lead from a fall in European government bond prices and the stronger housing data."
2007-03-16,"China to Rein in Bank Lending, Ballooning Surplus",0.033281492170381066,"China will take steps to contain a renewed burst in bank lending and a larger-than-expected rise in the country's controversial trade surplus last month, senior officials said on Friday. Speaking on the sidelines of a annual parliamentary session, which ends on Friday, central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said the authorities would place further controls on bank lending.""From a commercial perspective, it is understandable for the banks to lend aggressively at the beginning of the year,"" Zhou told reporters. ""But from a macro perspective, after serious study, we decided to place further controls (on it),"" he said. He did not offer any timeframe. Lending data released this week reinforced concern that banks, awash with cash, may fund a new round of speculative investment. Lending surged by 413.8 billion yuan in February, compared with an increase of 149.1 billion yuan in February 2006. Separately, Commerce Minister Bo Xilai said the nation's trade surplus had been ""too large"" in February and reaffirmed that Beijing planned new steps to trim exports and step up imports. China on Monday reported its second-biggest monthly trade surplus on record, dwarfing forecasts and handing fresh ammunition to critics who say Beijing is giving its exporters an unfair edge by holding down the yuan. The surplus for February ballooned to $23.76 billion, with exports leaping 51.7% from a year earlier. ""We are also very nervous about that,"" Bo said of the size of February's surplus. ""We're seriously studying the whole situation to find the underlying reasons."" One reason for the surge was a propensity among Chinese firms to ship their goods out of the country to prevent them from being penalized by possible policy changes, he said. The Commerce ministry would make appropriate adjustments to the export tax rebate system, paying special attention to the area of processing trade as that generated the biggest portion of the surplus, Bo told reporters, without giving details. Zhou also said the authorities were keeping a wary eye on inflation, which he said had been running too high. Asked whether the central bank would raise interest rates soon, Zhou said they were seriously studying the inflation situation and would take ""appropriate measures""."
2007-04-16,Is Goldilocks Getting Wrinkles?,0.1371666666666667,"A market expert told CNBC that the Goldilocks economic scenario is getting a little long in the tooth and is especially concerned with the financial sector, which may show cracks in the façade this week.""The stock market is overvalued,"" said Richard Suttmeier, chief market strategist at RightSide.com. ""I'm viewing this as another opportunity for investors to lighten up on positions.""Suttmeier said he was particularly worried about the financial sector. ""Sure, some of the financial stocks are rallying, but that's because they're coming off pretty much near 52-week lows,"" he said.But Charles Lieberman, chief investment officer at Advisors Capital Management, said the market has a lot further to go.""I think those sectors are actually very interesting to buy because they are at lows,"" said Lieberman. ""They haven't participated in the rally.""Lieberman highlighted the current economic environment of moderate growth, low interest rates and ""just so much liquidity you have to use all of the fingers of your hand to count up the deals.""'The conditions are really idyllic for a market advance,"" Lieberman said.But Suttmeier said this ""Goldilocks"" economic outlook was no longer relevant.""I think Goldilocks is getting wrinkles,"" he said. ""It's an old scenario, now we're in a situation where we're seeing inflation above the Fed's target range, and we're seeing that the distress in the banking system.""Suttmeier predicted that warnings signs are likely to appear this week when more than 60 community and regional banks are set to report.""They're going to tell us that they're having an increase in 90-day loans and noncurrent loans and that is going to be a problem,"" he said."

2007-07-27,It's Time for the Lightning Round!,0.07411564625850342,"Pride International : This is a contract driller and a stock that Cramer likes in this market. “Let’s buy it.” American Software : It’s a fine tech company, Cramer said, but he’d rather go with names like Riverbed Technology , Cisco , Hewlett-Packard  or Dell . Peabody Energy : Even though oil is up, the government is not helping coal companies like Peabody, Cramer said. He has liked coal, but it’s not at the right level right now. Foundry Networks : “This happens to be another stock in the sweet spot,” Cramer said. He believes stocks like FDRY, which didn’t go down at all today, are going to work in this environment because they don’t need debt, they don’t have to do a leveraged buyout and they don’t need the domestic consumer.RPM International : “It’s not going to work, but it’s not going to hurt you either,” Cramer said. Anadigics : If you look, you’ll see that most tech stocks, including ANAD are at or close to a 52-week high. “I can hold on to that,” Cramer said. Applied Materials : A company with low valuation and a lot of cash, and it’s moving into solar. Cramer predicts one down and three up for AMAT, which to him says “buy, buy, buy.” Immersion : Immersion has never made anyone money, Cramer said. Sell it. Cumulus Media : It’s been straight down since it announced it would be bought out on Monday, Cramer said. “I need you out of Cumulus.” Intel : Intel is one of the reasons why Cramer is so bullish on Dell and Hewlett-Packard, as they are big buyers of Intel chips. That being said, Cramer would “rather see you out of Intel and into Hewlett-Packard.” Pfizer : “Pfizer doesn’t have it,” Cramer said. He would swap out of PFE and buy some Schering-Plough .

2007-09-04,"Congress, White House: Up For Late Summer Fight?",0.05667903525046384,"Summer isn't over yet, but the languid pace that has prevailed in Washington since Congress left town in August has now definitively vanished. On every front, the White House and Congress, Republicans and Democrats, are girding for political action that will unfold rapidly with its ultimate consequences uncertain.Let's look at the most important points of engagement: --The elephant in the room: the Iraq war. This is President Bush's top priority and there's no close second. Facing resistance from Congressional Democrats, Bush sought a momentum boost with his surprise visit to Iraq in advance of Gen. David Petraeus' testimony on the troop surge in Washington next week. Bush and even some Democrats see signs of military progress; Democratic leaders said the US military commitment isn't leading to political reconciliation that would allow troops to come home. --The new wild card: the economy. When you have a single issue stirring fear and anxiety among hedge fund markets, pension fund investors, and moderate-income homeowners, there's potential for a powerful political reaction. That's what the mortgage mess has produced. Bush responded last week with his limited assistance proposals, while Democrats want more -- including potential cash bailouts. This may be one area where Democratic and Republican choose to work together. --The old battle: taxes and spending. Republicans bruised by the unpopularity of Iraq and scandal drama (see: Craig, Larry) are spoiling to battle Democrats over one of their familiar themes. That's what Bush is threatening to veto spending bills from the Democratic Congress, and almost certainly would do the same if Democrats could muster the votes to raise taxes on private equity. The GOP badly needs to reclaim the tax-spending brand. --The backdrop: the 2008 elections. The campaign trail has almost supplanted Washington as the focus of national attention already. And that trend will only increase. A Wednesday night debate in New Hampshire will showcase the tightrope Republican candidates have to walk between distancing themselves from an unpopular White House and building support among the Republican base. The next morning, the new Republican candidate, Fred Thompson will enter the race in Iowa (having appeared on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" on the same night of that GOP debate). Can Thompson be the Reagan heir in the race? and can Barack Obama sharpen his change message enough to win a change election against Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary? I travel to Iowa this afternoon to see both candidates. And I will blog on what I see. Questions?  Comments?  Write to politicalcapital@cnbc.com."
2007-09-12,"Chinese Retail Sales Surge, Partly on Inflation",0.20686507936507936,"China's retail sales growth surged in August to its quickest pace in more than three years, beating forecasts, but analysts said the jump largely reflected stronger inflation, not necessarily quicker underlying growth. Retail sales, which are tracked in nominal terms, grew 17.1% from a year earlier, compared with 16.4% in July. The uptick roughly tracked a rise in annual consumer inflation in August to 6.5%, from 5.6% in July. ""Retail sales growth is obviously strong. The problem is that the figures are being pushed up by the rising inflation as well. So actually, on a real basis, I don't think there's much of an acceleration,"" said Paul Cavey, an economist with Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong. August's pace, the quickest since May 2004, beat economists' expectations of a 16.5% rise. Consumer inflation data, released on Tuesday, also surprised on the upside. Beijing would welcome an increase in real buying activity by the country's consumers. It is trying to tilt its economy away from what economists call an unsustainable reliance on exports -- to the tune of 40% of national output. Not only does China's gaping trade surplus -- it hit $25 billion in August -- contribute to tensions with its major trading partners, it also exposes it more to any downturn in the United States or other economies. Cavey said that a lynchpin of Beijing's efforts to spur spending would be their effectiveness in the countryside, and that a recent epidemic among pigs was likely to blunt growth in spending there this year. ""We will expect retail sales growth to continue to be strong next year as the countryside gets over all this,"" he said. In the details, the retail sales data suggested a significant impact from the recent spike in food price inflation. Sales of grain and edible oils and meat, eggs and poultry, two of the categories where price rises have been most striking, rose 44% and 45.2%, respectively. Still, Lin Songli, senior economist at Guosen Securities in Beijing, said the figures showed that consumption was starting to take up a greater role in driving the world's fastest-growing major economy. ""Consumption growth has not reached its peak yet, and we are now expecting even higher growth rates in coming months,"" Lin said."
2007-11-14,Merrill Taps Thain After Fink Demanded Full Tally,0.0005917382783054483,"Merrill Lynch'sdecision to name John Thain as its new chief executive came after the firm's first choice, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, demanded that Merrill make a full accounting of its subprime exposure, CNBC has learned.Thain, who has been CEO of NYSE Euronext for nearly four years, will succeed Stanley O'Neal, who stepped down in late October after Merrill reported huge writedowns from subprime-related losses.Merrill's  selection of Thain was a surprise because the firm had recently indicated to Fink that the job was his if he wanted it. CNBC has learned that Fink said he would take the job but only if Merrill did a full accounting of its subprime exposure. At that point, Merrill, which owns 49% of BlackRock , moved in a different direction and decided to go with Thain instead. A Merrill spokesman told CNBC that ""Merrill Lynch can confirm that Laurence Fink was not offered the job of CEO at Merrill Lynch.""Replacement for ThainThe NYSE  will name Duncan Niederauer, the current chief operating officer, as Thain's replacement.Merrill ousted CEO Stan O'Neal after posting an $8.4 billion write-down for the third quarter. The write-down resulted in a $2.3 billion loss, the largest quarterly loss in the company's 93-year history.Thain has a blue-chip Wall Street resume, with credentials sharpened by running NYSE and his time as a former co-president at Goldman Sachs. Thain took over the NYSE in January 2004 after longtime CEO Richard Grasso was forced to resign over his $188 million pay package. Thain sought to present a new image for the exchange and pushed through some major structural changes, including the move to electronic trading.Thain had also been rumored to be a possible CEO candidate for Citigroup , whose chief executive Chuck Prince also stepped down following big subprime-related losses. No replacement for Prince has been named.Created Global ExchangeThain, who is credited with remaking the NYSE into the world's first truly global exchange, is no stranger to the investment world. He started out on the bond desk at Goldman Sachs and left the firm as its chief operating officer.Many say he's also exactly what Merrill Lynch needs after last month's ouster of Stan O'Neal. The former CEO was not well liked by Merrill's army of some 16,000 brokers, and lost their confidence after the company recorded its biggest loss since being founded 93 years ago.Merrill Lynch ratcheted up a $2.24 billion loss during the third quarter because of investments in subprime mortgages and other risky types of debt. It joined dozens of other major financial institutions who are getting squeezed as investors steer away from riskier securities, causing credit markets to tighten significantly.There is also speculation by a number of analysts that Merrill may take a $3 billion fourth-quarter writedown. That would be besides the $7.9 billion charge taken last quarter. Merrill originally said it would write down only $4.5 billion because of the credit crisis.Faces Daunting TaskThain faces a daunting task of cleaning up those investments, and reviving morale at a firm badly bruised during the past few months. There has been speculation that a new CEO would be forced to turn around Merrill's fixed income division, a department that he once ran for Goldman in the 1990s.Meanwhile, Fink may be a possible replacement for Prince, who left the helm of Citigroup less than a week after O'Neal stepped down from Merrill. Thain was also said to be considered to run the nation's biggest bank.Prince was forced out of his job after Citi's profit fell 57 percent in the third quarter after it booked $6 billion in asset markdowns and other credit-related losses. The night Prince resigned, the company estimated it would need to write down another $8 billion to $11 billion in the fourth quarter.Thain leaves behind a transformed exchange now locked in competition with rival Nasdaq Stock Market. His first task after taking over in 2004 was the acquisition of electronic trading platform Archipelago Holdings. It was the first step in bringing NYSE into the 21st century, which ultimately led to the creation of a mostly electronic market last year.He also shepherded the NYSE's April acquisition of European rival Euronext, which operated bourse's in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon. The Associated Press contributed to this report."
2007-11-19,Expert Advice: More Danger Likely in Financials,0.10540000000000001,"Investors should stay away from financial stocks and be cautious about commodity and material investments as well, according to one money manager.""This credit unwinding has a lot further to go,"" Jack De Gan, chief investment officer of Boston-based Harbor Advisory told CNBC.  He recalled Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein's observation that the low point in financial securities won't be reached with the markdowns, but with the liquidations, which he thinks are still to come.    He made an exception for Berkshire Hathaway , his firm's largest holding, which is 25 percent higher than it was in August, when news of the credit crunch started to break.    De Gan is also reluctant to venture into larger industrials.  ""If credit does contract the way we think it will, the financials will have to contract their balance sheets, and that will slow the general economy,"" he said.    So where's an investor to go?   ""I'd want to buy the technology stocks which are smaller, more 'nichey,' focused in an area where they can take market share and grow, even if the overall market is stagnant,"" De Gan said.    He suggested that investors who bought consumer products stocks like Clorox several months ago stay with those stocks, even though they have become quite pricey.    ""They're a safe haven,"" he said.  ""There are going to be very good buying opportunities, for instance in the financials, in the next six to 12 months, so I think the consumer staples are a safe place to hide.  They are not credit sensitive.  Their business is very durable.  You can stay there and watch for other opportunities.""He also cautioned against going into basic material or commodity investments, noting that they are showing signs of overinvestment similar to the housing and technology bubbles of years past."
2007-11-20,Pick a Direction and Go With It!,0.06855742296918765,"PICK A DIRECTION AND GO WITH IT: The headline: Stocks Finish Higher After Fed October Minutes Spark Roller-Coaster The price action in the market was indicative of the beginning of a bottom, Jeff Macke said. Tuesday saw the first signs of life from the bulls in some time. Pete Najarian agreed. Stocks look like they’re starting to find a “smoothing bottom,” he said. As financials fell apart, volatility never spiked, which helped on the rally. OIL RECORD CLOSE: The headline: Crude Oil Surges 3.6% to $98.03; Up 61% So Far This Year The time is right to get long Chevron (CVX), Guy Adami said. It’s cheaper than ExxonMobil (XOM). Investors shouldn’t think $100 is the endgame for oil, either, Pete Najarian said. Look for crude to continue higher after it breaches that level. SANTA’S SLAY: The headline:Target (TGT) Unexpectedly Misses Estimates, Making Holiday Retail Picture Even Bleaker TGT acted terrible on Tuesday, Karen Finerman and Jeff Macke agreed. The fact that its apparel and home furnishings brands – the areas that it has been able to dominate Wal-Mart (WMT) – are no longer doing as well is concerning, according to Karen. Over time, she wants to own TGT but she’s still waiting for a good level to jump in. Jeff Macke wouldn’t play Target either way in this market. AFTER HOURS ACTION: WHOLE FOODS:The headline:(WFMI) Profit Slides But Sales Climb 25% Whole Foods is fighting an uphill battle, Jeff Macke said. The economic conditions aren’t right and the company is about to find itself a real competitor in Tesco (TESO). Pete Najarian said Whole Foods’ increased dividend should be good for a short-term pop. WILL GOOGLE GO TO $900: The headline: Google (GOOG) Jumps 4% After Credit Suisse Sets $900 Price Target Stocks like GOOG, Apple (AAPL) and Research In Motion (RIMM) are starting to find comfortable levels at which to get back in, Pete Najarian said. Guy Adami would rather stick with Microsoft (MSFT), which has the biggest upside on a percentage-basis, he said. Guy predicted MSFT trades in the $40s next year. Jeff Macke also recommended staying with Microsoft. It’s the “easier way to make money,” he said. Unfortunately, they are still years away from targeting stem cells to create organs, Pete Najarian said, so its too early to trade on the headline. In the meantime, he recommended ISIS Pharmaceuticals (ISIS) and Sangamo Biosciences (SGMO) as current plays on cancer treatment. OPRAH’S FAVORITE THINGS: The headline: Oprah Releases Highly-Anticipated List of Her Favorite Things Shares of Williams-Sonoma (WSM) and Deckers (DECK), the makers of some of the items on Oprah’s list, actually moved higher after the list was revealed. Karen Finerman said it wasn’t a “dumb trade,” as Oprah really can move markets. ______________________________________________________Got something to say?

2008-01-24,Hawkish ECB Official Pushes Euro Up vs. Dollar,0.09264420520999468,"The dollar fell against the euro on Thursday as strong German business confidence data andtough inflation comments by a European Central Bank policy-maker dashed hopes for a near-term interest rate cut in the euro zone.An improvement in investors' appetite for risk, following a sharp rebound in European stocks, pushed down the U.S. dollar against high-yielding currencies such as the British pound, the Australian and Canadian dollars.ECB's governing council member Axel Weber said the Federal Reserve's surprise decision to cut interest rates by 75 basis points on Tuesday had not shifted the ECB focus on euro zoneinflation, dampening rising expectations that it too will have to cut rates soon.""The fact that there seems to be a bit of calm in the equity markets has in some regard sent the forex market towards selling dollars,"" said John McCarthy, director of trading at ING Capital Markets in New York.""Weber made the usual hawkish comments which underpin the euro and we are just seeing follow through from that."" The euro  jumped to session high of $1.4733, on track for a third consecutive day of gains. The dollar was flat versus the yen . Against the Swiss franc, the dollar fell .The euro had come under selling pressure in recent weeks as signs emerged that weakness in the U.S. economy is having a knock-on effect on the euro zone, fueling the argument for arate cut by the ECB. Some of those concerns eased slightly after German corporate sentiment unexpectedly rose in January, bolstering policymakers' assertion that the euro zone economy can withstand turmoil in financial markets. ""The numbers out of Germany were good. You are getting a follow through of what we saw overnight,"" said Brian Taylor, head currency trader ay M&T Bank in Buffalo, New York.""They are consistently saying that growth is okay, there is going to be some effect from a U.S. slow down, but in their view they are saying the economy is going to be strong and(inflation) is going to be an issue in terms of their monetary policy.""The New Zealand and the Australian dollars benefited from the improvement in risk appetite. These currencies are often targets of carry trades, a strategy in which investors borrowin a low-yielding currency such as the yen to buy higher-yielding currencies and assets.The Australian dollar rose  against the dollar, as did the kiwi .There was little reaction to a report showing that the pace of existing home sales in the United States fell by 2.2 percent in December to a slower-than-expected 4.89 million-unit annual rate. That confirmed market perceptions that the housing market turmoil, which is threatening to push the economy into a recession, is far from over."
2008-03-14,Maui Close to Averaging $4 for Gas,0.013012987012987014,"""Maui No Kai Oi"" is a popular Hawaiian saying that means Maui is the best. Mike Sweeney recently moved to this idyllic island from Denver and was hit with the other side of living in paradise with his first visit to the gas pump: Maui is also No. 1 in gas prices. ""After seeing the total, I won't be smiling,"" Sweeney said as he watched the numbers on the Chevron pump spin faster than a slot machine. The pump finally stopped at $97.20, which put 24.5 gallons in his Chevrolet Avalanche. He was elated about living on Maui and being reunited with his black, super-size pickup truck, which just arrived from Colorado, but he wasn't so thrilled about paying nearly $4 for a gallon of regular. While the price of oil climbs above $110 a barrel, most Americans dread the day they will have to pay $4. On this tropical island and a few stations in California, $4 gas has already arrived, straining the pocketbooks of residents and businesses. Maui is on the verge of becoming first area in the nation to average $4 for a gallon of regular. The average price in Wailuku reached $3.934 on Thursday, the highest price in AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge Report. At several stations, it was a penny shy of $4. In the remote coastal town of Hana, it was around $4.40 a gallon. ""Outrageous. Completely outrageous,"" said Janet Carone, of Wailuku. The high price to get around has hurt many families, like the Carones. They're coping by driving less, carpooling or working more. ""It has a big effect because our housing is high, our food is high, and the gas prices just make it worse,"" she said. Other than AAA, perhaps no one on Maui tracks local gas prices better than Deok Lee, owner of Airport Taxi. He maintains a detailed record of gas expenses using Excel spreadsheets on his laptop. In just nine days, Lee had spent $300 to fuel his Toyota Sienna van. Like his drivers, the more Lee pays for gas, the less money he brings home. His pay shrinks by the day -- and by the gallon. ""Crazy,"" he said about the prices. ""Ridiculous."" Fuel cost has more than tripled since he took over the business in 1999, and it's forcing him to consider trading his van, which costs $80 to fill, for a smaller four-cylinder car. ""Unfortunately, it's going to take away some comfort for the customers. But you gotta do what you gotta do,"" he said. Lee expects many cabbies will be forced out of business if fuel prices keep rising. Chuck Gamarata, who operates the only limousine taxi on the island, is forced to work longer hours to compensate for the gas prices. He's still taking home about $10 less each day. ""You add that up over a year's period, that's thousands of dollars,"" he said. ""It hurts. It hurts bad."" Other businesses are also feeling pinched. Todd Winn, co-owner of North Shore Explorers, has been hit hard since launching the tour company in September. It takes 150 gallons of diesel, at $4.20 a gallon, to fill up his 30-foot rigid hull inflatable boat, which gets about a mile per gallon. It also costs more than $100 to fill up the Ford F-350 to tow it. While the new company is trying to build up clientele, it may be forced to raise rates or add a fuel surcharge. ""It's been dramatic enough that we've actually seen our original business model blown out the window,"" Winn said. ""It's been quite costly and we've had to cut costs in other areas to make it work."" He shakes his head when hearing about people in other states complaining about gas prices. Maui residents remember the good ol' days of $3 gas. ""It's just the price of living here,"" Winn said. ""I'm not sure it's fair. But at the same time, it's not going to get me to move back to the mainland to pay a buck less for a gallon of gasoline."" Hawaii is the most oil-dependent state in the nation, with more than 90 percent of its energy coming from imported oil. The state's economy is also extremely sensitive to oil prices globally because it depends on airplanes and ships to bring in tourists and all of its goods. Marie Montgomery, spokeswoman for AAA Hawaii, said it's a little comfort for islanders that gas prices haven't risen as fast as in other states, such as California. On Thursday, California hit another record with an average of $3.609, overtaking Hawaii ($3.587) for the nation's highest gas prices. Meanwhile, the national average has risen to a record $3.267, according to the auto club. But Maui, which doesn't have a major public transportation system, now has all the California cities beat by at least a quarter a gallon. Residents here have long wondered why gas prices on the island are so much higher than on neighboring Oahu, where Honolulu gas is about 50 cents less. ""It's like we work just to pay gas,"" resident Yolanda Ellis said. ""Funny how our gas goes up but our pay stays the same."" Hawaii, which imports most of its crude oil from Alaska and Indonesia, has two refineries on Oahu operated by Chevron  and Tesoro Hawaii . Both companies blame the Maui price on higher transportation costs, even though islands further away, such as the Big Island, have lower prices. They also cite several other factors, such as volume, competition and higher local taxes on Maui. Chevron spokesman Albert Chee said the price, in most cases, is set by the station operators and owners. The company sets the retail prices for only six stations it owns out of the 63 Chevron-branded outlets in Hawaii. The company wouldn't disclose the difference in wholesale price between Maui and Oahu. However, Chee said: ""It's not 50 cents. It's not even half."" ""The difference between Oahu and Maui of 50 cents is not flowing into my pocket,"" he said. Chevron noted that the cost of crude oil has spiked 20 percent in the past 30 days, while gasoline has increased 9 percent nationwide and only 5 percent in Hawaii. Not everyone seemed upset with the pump prices on Maui. Tourists, who pay an average close to $300 a night for a hotel room, don't seem to mind. ""If the gas would've been higher, we still would've gone,"" said Jack Glisson, of Jacksonville, Ill. ""It didn't make any difference."""
2008-03-18,Market Insider/Tuesday Look Ahead,0.029566544566544565,"Stocks held their own Monday, even after the shocking demise of Bear Stearns. But the market no doubt benefited from the view of many investors that the Fed will deliver a hefty rate cut when it meets Tuesday. Right now, traders are betting on a full point rate cut by the Fed, which would take the target Fed funds rate to 2 percent. Just Friday, the Fed funds futures showed traders believed the Fed would cut by 0.75 percent. But the weekend rescue of Bear Stearns in a Fed-engineered buyout by JP Morgan  and other extraordinary moves by the Fed changed that view. Two investment banks report earnings before the bell Tuesday, and that news will also be key in setting the course for markets. Other important news includes producer price inflation data, due at 8:30 a.m., and housing starts, also reported at 8:30 a.m. One of the most encouraging events for stocks in recent sessions is the pricing Tuesday afternoon of the giant $18 billion Visa IPO. The offering is expected to price after the bell Tuesday, and start trading Wednesday. There has been some real investor excitement about the offering, which is expected to price between $37 and $42 per share. Earnings CentralGoldman  is expected to report first quarter earnings of $2.58 per share, a decline of 61 percent, on revenues of $7.47 billion, a 41 percent decline. Lehman is expected to report earnings per share of $0.72, a 63 percent decline, on revenues of $3.351 billion, a 34 percent decrease. The shares of financial institutions were under pressure Monday after the Bear Stearns news, with Wall Street's investment banks particularly hard hit. The S&P financial sector was down 1.5 percent. Lehman stock was the most tattered of all the firms as an uncomfortable level of rumors swirled around its shares. The stock at some points during the day was down more than a third, and it traded on volume of 224 million shares, nearly eight times its 10 day average of 33 million shares. Lehman battled back. CEO Richard Fuld said in a statement that the Fed's announcement Sunday that it would allow investment banks to use its discount window takes the liquidity issue ""off the table for the entire industry."" Previously, commercial banks were the only institutions that could use the Fed's short term borrowing window. Traders said the Fed's rule change was a big reason why stock trading was so orderly Monday. Lehman's CFO Erin Callan is expected to appear on ""Closing Bell"" Tuesday. Chop, ChopDeutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Joe LaVorgna is one who changed his view on the Fed and rate cuts over the weekend. He now expects a full point rate cut when the Fed announces its decision at 2:15 p.m. ""The only way I could see the Fed not going 100 (a full point) is if they accompany the 75 cut with their intention to purchase GSE debt, Fannie and Freddie debt,"" he said. Speaking of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the Wall Street Journal was reporting late Monday that the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight is close to reducing capital requirements for the two companies, a move that would give the firms more flexibility in buying mortgages. ""Look at the Fed's action. They basically are telling you they are going to do something dramatic. I don't think 0.75 is particularly dramatic anymore. I think it has been priced into the market,"" he said. LaVorgna said the Fed's statement will likely note that there's still downside risk. ""The Fed is not going to worry about inflation. It's going to worry about growth...we're not out of the woods yet,"" he said. Market MayhemThe Dow finished 21 points higher at 11,972, after a nearly 200 point swoon. The Dow is now down 9.9 percent since the start of the year and 2.1 percent from a year ago. The Nasdaq though was bloodied in Monday's trading, scoring a 1.6 percent, or 35 point decline. Nasdaq is down 18 percent year-to-date and is off 9.1 percent in the past 52 weeks. The S&P 500 slipped 11 points to 1276, a level 13 percent below where it started the year. The Bear Stearns story ratcheted up anxiety about risk in the market, despite equities relatively tame reaction. Treasury yields fell as buyer moved into the safety of Treasurys. The 10-year was yielding 3.314 percent, and the yield on the two-year slipped to 1.333 percent, its lowest level since July, 2003. The dollar continued its weakening trend, losing 0.5 percent against the Euro  and 2 percent against the yen . Some of the real action though was in the commodities markets where sellers dumped energy, grains and metals (with the exception of gold). Gold finished at $1001.40 per troy ounce, up 0.3 percent.Crude oil  fell 4.1 percent to $105.68 a barrel. Gasoline fell 6.9 percent and natural gas fell 7.8 percent. Silver fell 1.7 percent, copper fell 3.5 percent. Soybeans, corn and wheat all fell sharply and sugar and coffee fell more than 10 percent. Joseph Terranova, partner at Thelogicaltrader.net, said commodities prices could get a lift from the Fed's rate action Tuesday, but watch out Wednesday and Thursday. ""When market conditions get like they did this morning, you need to pare back and take a fresh look,"" said Terranova. He said it's time to reduce some risk from portfolios, but investors should look to add to positions heading into the second quarter. He expects commodities to be flattish for a while. ""I'm going to wait and see what Bernanke gives the street. I'll come back a week from today and we'll be putting stuff back in place ... But the oil story is not over,"" he said.

2008-05-27,Bank of America to Boost Stake in China's CCB,0.15332108968472602,"Bank of America said on Tuesday it would exercise part of an option to buy shares of China Construction Bank, investing HK$14.52 billion (US$1.86 billion) and raising its stake in China's second-largest bank to 10.75 percent. Bank of America, the No. 2 U.S. bank by assets, said it intended to buy 6 billion of CCB's Hong Kong-listed shares around June 5 for about HK$2.42 each under a formula set when it first agreed to buy a 9 percent stake in CCB investment in June 2005 for US$3 billion. With CCB shares closing at HK$6.65 in Tuesday trading, Bank of America is getting the stake at a 64 percent discount. The new shares are currently worth about HK$39.9 billion (US$5.11 billion), offering some good news for a U.S. retail banking giant that has been hit by rising consumer credit losses and a weakening economy. Bank of America earlier this year raised more than $12 billion to boost capital required by bank regulators. Some analysts have forecast that BofA will cut its dividend in the second half. The investment in one of the world's hottest markets has paid off handsomely for the North Carolina bank. CCB stock has surged 83 percent since the bank's October 2005 IPO. After the latest transaction, Bank of America said it would hold about 25.1 billion shares, which means US$4.86 billion of investments by the bank currently have a paper value of US$21.4 billion. Bank of America spokesman Bob Stickler said the bank would not record any gain from the transaction because the new shares cannot be sold until August 2011 without CCB's consent. The shares will be carried at cost.     Shares For Sale? Last month, several press reports said BofA was looking to shed part of its CCB stake to raise capital needed to cope with a weakening U.S. economy. BofA is also preparing to take over Countrywide Financial , the largest U.S. home lender slammed by the mortgage slump. Stickler declined to comment on speculation that BofA was considering selling CCB shares, though the latest transaction will likely do nothing to end the market talk. ""We've been in talks with the Chinese government for a number of months. Anything we do is in consultation with them"" and with the management of CCB, Stickler said. The shares acquired in 2005 have a three-year lock-up that expires October 2008. By exercising the call option now, BofA ""starts the clock"" and increases its flexibility to sell the new shares down the road, Stickler said. Bank of America had talks with CCB and SAFE Investment (Huijin), the Chinese government body that controls CCB, about exercising a portion of its call option. BofA will purchase its new shares from Huijin. Under the 2005 stock purchase agreement, BofA can increase its stake to just under 20 percent. CCB currently has a market value of nearly US$200 billion, or one-fourth more than that of BofA. Last month BofA Chief Financial Officer Joe Price told Reuters the bank would likely raise its stake first before considering any share sales. Bank of America  shares were unchanged at $33.94 on the New York Stock Exchange early Tuesday afternoon."
2008-06-02,Fed's Lockhart: US Economy Still Faces Serious Risks,0.019583333333333335,"It is too soon to declare turmoil in financial markets over and while the U.S. economy should gradually recover, this outlook faces big risks, a top Federal Reserve policy-maker said Monday. ""Although conditions have improved on some fronts, I don't feel we can yet ""breathe easy."" The path of the economy is still enveloped in considerable uncertainty, and serious risks remain,"" Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart said in prepared remarks. A copy of his speech to a luncheon event for the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce was made available to the media prior to delivery. Lockhart is not a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee this year. The Fed has slashed interest rates by 3.25 percentage points since last September to shield the economy from a global credit crunch. That squeeze was sparked by a U.S. housing crisis that has chilled growth and threatened to tip the economy into recession. But Lockhart signaled he was optimistic that the country would escape this fate. ""On balance, I'm expecting a weak first half followed by some improvement in the second half as the drags on growth I mentioned earlier gradually diminish,"" he said. But Lockhart also stressed that he was still concerned by the threat of renewed financial instability undermining growth. ""We remain in a period of considerable uncertainty. There are very real risks to this outlook,"" he said. He said an oil price shock, further upsets in financial markets and a more severe-than-expected downturn in housing could all upset his forecast for U.S. growth to pick up somewhat in the second half of 2008. Lockhart also said inflation was elevated ""with hints of rising inflation expectations,"" but said it should abate as energy and food prices moderate and a softer economy limits the ability of firms to pass on higher prices to customers. ""My base case for inflation assumes a fall-off from the current elevated level of inflation supported by some moderation of energy and food price increases,"" Lockhart said. ""I also expect soft economic growth to constrain the ability of businesses to pass through energy and other costs and raise prices in the coming months,"" he added."
2008-06-09,Wal-Mart A Year Later: High Prices Now Bring In Customers,-0.07931110556110556,"A year ago Wal-Mart management said that high gas prices were hurting their customers and store sales.Now, a year later, gas prices are even higher and Wal-Mart management says those expensive costs are bringing customers into its stores. So I asked CEO Lee Scott where the tipping point in terms of changing consumer behavior. His answer was an interesting one. Scott said it was undeniable that Wal-Mart's core customers were the first ones impacted by the spike in gasoline prices and they bought less. What changed? Scott said two things: (1) Wal-Mart improved its store experience (cleaned up aisles, added brands to its merchandise and refocused on retail) and (2) the economic stress spread from the bottom up and brought in new customers at ""the right"" time (i.e. After Wal-Mart improved stores.) Scott said that this trend doesn't mean that business will fall off when the economy improves. Wal-Mart executives also made it clear that they're interested in expanding health care and green initiatives. In other words, they're trying to anticipate where product trends are headed and carve out a low cost niche to feed developing needs. Wal-Mart management still thinks that it can tap into the middle income customer base that Target has dominated for the past few years. While Wal-Mart's past attempts to draw in those customers via merchandising like clothing (remember Mark Eisen?) have failed, this time around the economy may bring those customers in-store. At least, that's what management is betting on.Questions? Comments? retaildetail@cnbc.com"

""Neither one of these guys understands what's going on, they don't understand currency markets, economies, they don't understand the world,"" Rogers said. ""Both of them are going to cause us more problems than they're going to solve.""Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama pledged to reverse the economic failures and blamed the Republicans for the poor shape of the U.S. economy in his speech on Thursday formally accepting to run for president for his partyBut Rogers said this was unlikely. ""He's talking about spending a lot of money … I don't consider that very good, going deeper into debt. The United States is already the largest debtor nation in the history of the world. I'm not sure that that's going to solve anything,"" he said.(Click Here for a Video of Jim Rogers' interview)Republican presumptive candidate Sen. John McCain chose Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate.'Bailing Out their Friends on Wall Street'Deep changes are needed in the U.S. system and big Wall Street banks should not be rescued by the authorities when they run into trouble, to avoid moral hazard, Rogers told CNBC Europe.""They're bailing out Wall Street, because all their friends are on Wall Street,"" he said. ""When Ben Bernanke gets a phone call from the head Lehman, he takes the call, but if some poor school teacher in Oklahoma calls him, he doesn't take the call."" ""He's dealing with his friends on Wall Street trying to save them when in fact he should let them fail. That would be the better solution, at least for 300 million Americans,"" Rogers added.The economic stimulus package launched this year to try and fend off recession in the U.S. is unlikely to have positive consequences in the long term, despite a higher-than-forecast advance of gross domestic product in the second quarter, Rogers said.Supporting troubled investment banks instead of letting them go bust prevents a cleansing of the economy while putting additional burdens on taxpayers, but neither of the two candidates is likely to stop this, he added.""If you happen to be friends with whoever wins, sure, you're going to have a better time in the next four years. But the rest of us, the 300 million Americans, are going to be worse off in four years. In fact the world will be worse off,"" Rogers said."
2008-10-16,Dow Closes Up After 700-Point Swing,0.09646921935654329,"A late-day rally gave the Dow industrials a triple-digit boost after a volatile session in which the blue-chip index swung within a 700-point range.""I think this is bargain hunting and there are some bargains out there. Some of these stocks are at historic lows,"" Warren Simpson, managing director at Stephens Capital Management in Little Rock, Ark., told Reuters.Traders said another cause for the day's wild swings was unwinding of hedged options on the S&P 500 ahead of October options expirations on Friday. The expirations triggered several big buys at the end of the day.The day was book-ended with rallies. Stocks lurched out of the gate following some not-horrible economic reports: Consumer prices came in flatwhile weekly jobless claims fell. But that rally fizzled after mid-morning reports showed the Philadelphia Fed's index of mid-Atlantic factory activity fell much more than expected and industrial output hit a nearly 34-year low. The Dow Jones Industrial Average retested Friday's closing low around 8450, then fell through to a five-and-a-half year low.

    Reed, and Sen. Robert Menendez asked the US Treasury department
    to establish guidelines saying that banks receiving government
    capital injections should use the funds to restore their
    lending practices to levels prior to the onset of the credit
    crisis. ""Although we are supportive of your efforts to restore
    stability to the financial system through direct capital
    injections into financial institutions, we are concerned that
    if the program is not implemented correctly, it's effectiveness
    will be limited."" According to CNBC's website, the letter tells
    Treasury officials that they should issue guidelines that
    specify the type of lending allowed, encourage loan
    modifications, and provide more oversight of executive
    legislation. In this same vein, the Michigan congressional
    delegation has drafted a letter it intends to send to Federal
    Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry
    Paulson later this week, urging the two officials to use their
    ""broad regulatory authority"" to ""promote liquidity in the U.S.

    system and government reach into the private sector takes us
    full circle back to the 1930s. This will accelerate with a

    aggressively stepping into the private sector is the short term
    cure for all that ails from credit crisis. Longer term for the
    developed countries, it will create sclerotic economies unable
    to grow faster than 2% due to regulation and programs designed
    to effect social goals instead of profit targets. For now, all
    that matters is survival and socialism is embraced.Goldman to Cut 10% of Workforce: ReportGM Prepares to Layoff WorkersHow Bad

2009-02-09,Absolut Breakthrough: CBS Allows Spirits Ad During Grammys,0.17892992424242427,"Those tuning into the Grammys may have caught a glimpse of a television milestone, and it didn’t happen on stage at the music awards show.Absolut vodka debuted a new ad, marking the first time a spirits brand aired a commercial during the Grammys. More importantly, it was also a first for spirits advertising in prime time in several CBS markets. The ad, which ran in 15 of the largest media markets on many CBS-owned-and-operated stations, is a breakthrough for the spirits industry, which has been rebuffed in its attempts to buy airtime on the major networks in the past. No doubt, the proliferation of advertisements on cable stations and local network affiliates has laid the groundwork for this event. “We’re not surprised, it’s been a steady progression,” said Frank Coleman, a spokesman for the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, an industry trade group. Coleman said the television advertising of spirits brands has built steadily over the past decade, although it has leveled off more recently as companies have spent more of their ad budget online. Absolut, a Swedish vodka brand that was purchased by Pernod Ricard last year, has long been known for its memorable advertising. “I think we continue to take an innovative approach to media and advertising,” said Ian Crystal, brand director of Absolut Vodka at Pernod Ricard USA. Slideshow: Best Premium Liquor BrandsAccording to Crystal, there wasn’t any resistance at CBS and its affiliates. He attributes this to the “iconic” nature of the Absolut brand. For the first 25 years, the brand’s image was built around print advertising that centered on the distinctive shape of its bottle. But the campaign shifted in May 2007, with the launch of the “In An Absolut World” campaign. Now about 30 percent to 40 percent of the brand’s ad budget is spent on television and film advertising. According to Crystal, the campaign’s concept is about ideas, which translate well on film, and therefore lends itself to television advertising. The latest incarnation of the campaign is the “Hugs” spot, which depicts scenes from an idealized world. As the music of Louis Armstrong plays, people from around the world exchange hugs and other signs of affection rather than currency. The 30-second spot, created by ad agency TBWAChiatDay, will continue to air on broadcast and cable in seven key markets over the next week. Events like the Grammys are often used by advertisers as a way of reaching a mass audience joined by a common interest. Music is a leading interest among adults 21 years to 24 years old, who are Absolut’s key demographic. Last year, the Grammy Awards reached an estimated 17 million viewers. Ratings for Sunday’s show were not immediately available.

2009-04-20,"Economy Difficult, but Signs of Firming Seen: GE CEO",0.036920634920634916,"The economy is still difficult, but we’re seeing some signs of firming, General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt told CNBC in an interview. ""I think that while the economy is still difficult, we’re starting to firm,"" said Immelt. ""We’re starting to see that the sequential appliance orders are firming, we’re starting to see some signs that businesses are ready to invest again. I think in certain ways, companies have to make their own rallies right now…I think as we get more confidence in the system, we have to pull our ways out of this.” GE  is the parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com. GE posted better-than-expected quarterly profit last Friday, as a strong performance at its large energy operation offset declines at the GE Capital finance and NBC Universal units.“Financial services was tough as expected, but we still made money,” said Immelt. “Some of the shorter cycles like advertising on NBC are still in a difficult phase. [But] I was quite encouraged in our infrastructure orders and how our infrastructure businesses didCisco's CEO John Chambers agreed and explained his position on the economy. “You’re beginning to see governments and companies realize that [technology] is going be an area that is going to grow really well,” said Chambers. “Both technology will play a key role in the recovery, also the smart use of electricity…Recoveries don’t happen unless businesses take good business risks.” Slideshow: What Does $1 Trillion Look Like?"

According to the website TheDailyGreen , ""Last year, the Atlantic saw 16 named tropical storms -- from Arthur on May 30, which killed five and caused $78 million in damages to Belize, to Hurricane Paloma, which formed Nov. 5 and struck Cuba as a Category 4 monster that was the second-most intense hurricane ever recorded in November. ""All in all, there were eight Atlantic hurricanes and storms caused an estimated $41 billion in damages.This year might be even worse.

2009-07-14,Stocks End Slightly Higher; Earnings Little Help,0.13022017045454545,"Stocks closed slightly higher as a mostly positive start to earnings season was offset by the air quickly coming out of a rally in bank stocks.Financials surged Monday following a bullish call from noted analyst Meredith Whitney, but the sector was the market's biggest drag on Tuesday even though Goldman Sachs reported earnings that blew past Wall Street's expectations.Investors were wary after economic data showed larger-than-expected gains in producer prices and retail sales—but both readings came largely on the backs of auto and energy sales. With the two volatile areas stripped out, the numbers reflected anemic consumer growth that has been exacerbated by rising unemployment.The economic reports triggered expectations of inflation, and at least some of the late-morning pop in stocks was attributed to short-covering.""All the inflation bonds are acting very well today because it feels like the market is building in some inflationary expectations,"" said Dave Lutz, managing director of trading for Baltimore-based Stifel Nicolaus.Still, housing stocks showed surprising resiliency as analysts slowly warm to the group.Dow component Home Depot gained more than 2 percent and home builder Hovnanian Enterprises moved up more than 5 percent. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF  posted solid gains as the market clawed to positive ground.The iShares Barclays TIPS ETF  edged higher though it was off its peak. The fund is up about 5 percent in 2009.Hotel stocks, including Starwood, helped push the market higher.""We basically have a consumer reflation trade coming out right now,"" Lutz said. ""This is typical of a short-covering move.""Earnings season kicked into full gear as both Goldman  and Dow component Johnson & Johnson  posted numbers that surprised to the upside.Johnson & Johnson reported earnings of $3.2 billion that beat expectations, while also affirming its full-year outlook, sending shares higher.Goldman shares wavered following the company's earnings report, even though the numbers easily beat analyst estimates. The company reported net income for common shareholders of $2.7 billion, or $4.93 a share, compared with $2.05 billion, or $4.58 a share, in the closest year-earlier quarter."
2009-08-07,Another Hurdle for the Jobless: Credit Inquiries,-0.004473548223548207,"Digging out of debt keeps getting harder for the unemployed as more companies use detailed credit checks to screen job prospects.Out of work since December, Juan Ochoa was delighted when a staffing firm recently responded to his posting on Hotjobs.com with an opening for a data entry clerk. Before he could do much more, though, the firm checked his credit history.The interest vanished. There were too many collections claims against him, the firm said.“I never knew that nowadays they were going to start pulling credit checks on you even before you go for an interview,” said Mr. Ochoa, 46, who lost his job in December tracking inventory at a mining company in Santa Fe Springs, Calif. “Why would they need to pull a credit report? They’d need something like that if you were applying at a bank.”Once reserved for government jobs or payroll positions that could involve significant sums of money, credit checks are now fast, cheap and used for all manner of work. Employers, often winnowing a big pool of job applicants in days of nearly 10 percent unemployment, view the credit check as a valuable tool for assessing someone’s judgment.But job counselors worry that the practice of shunning those with poor credit may be unfair and trap the unemployed — who may be battling foreclosure, living off credit cards and confronting personal bankruptcy — in a financial death spiral: the worse their debts, the harder it is to get a job to pay them off.“How do you get out from under it?” asked Matthew W. Finkin, a law professor at the University of Illinois, who fears that the unemployed and debt-ridden could form a luckless class. “You can’t re-establish your credit if you can’t get a job, and you can’t get a job if you’ve got bad credit.”Others say that the credit check can be used to provide cover for discriminatory practices. Responding to complaints from constituents, lawmakers in a few states have recently proposed legislation that would restrict employers’ use of credit checks. While some measures languish, Hawaii has just imposed new restraints.Business executives say that they have an obligation to be diligent and to protect themselves from employees who may be unreliable, unwise or too susceptible to temptation to steal, and that credit checks are a help.“If I see too many negative things coming up on a credit check, it’s one of those things that raises a flag with me,” said Anita Orozco, director of human resources at Sonneborn, a petrochemical company based in Mahwah, N.J. She added that while bad credit alone would not be a reason to deny someone a job, it might reveal poor judgment.“If you see a history of bad decision-making, you don’t want that decision-making overflowing into your organization,” she said.More than 40 percent of employers use credit checks at least sometimes, according to a 2004 survey by the Society for Human Resource Management, up from 25 percent in 1998. The share has almost certainly risen today, say career counselors.“It has been an ongoing and increasing issue,” said Mollie de Rojas, district coordinator for the local operations of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.Credit counselors, worker advocates and the unemployed contend that a credit check is not always relevant to hiring decisions.“There’s no relationship between being a personal trainer making $12 an hour” and having a good credit history, said Janet L. Newcomb, a career counselor in Huntington Beach, Calif. “People are being turned down for jobs on the basis of things that really have nothing to do with qualifications.”That is the complaint of Kevin Palmer, 49, who for months lived at the same homeless shelter in Santa Ana, Calif., as Mr. Ochoa. After an interview that seemed to go well one day in June at a property management company, a manager walked him around the office the next day, introduced him to other employees and showed him an available desk.A credit check later, the offer vanished.It was “a glorified clerk’s job, taking homeowners’ complaints,” Mr. Palmer said of the opportunity, which paid about $39,000 and could have gotten him back on his feet after losing his condominium to foreclosure and filing for bankruptcy.Last month, he says he found a job at a property management company in San Francisco — a company that did not run a credit check on him. It is generally legal to run credit checks on job applicants, but some states have restrictions. In Washington, which has perhaps the most stringent requirement, a candidate’s credit history must be substantially related to the job under a law that took effect in 2007.Last month, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a measure that generally allows an employer to review a credit history only after making an offer and requires the credit check to be “directly related” to job qualifications.In California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar law. (New York law requires a background check’s findings to be related to the job, but it addresses criminal records and does not mention credit checks.)Lawmakers in Michigan and Ohio have proposed barring employers from using credit history in making employment decisions.“In my opinion, it’s discrimination,” said Representative Jon Switalski, the Democrat who proposed legislation in Michigan. “If you miss a few payments or you have medical debt, your skills as a pipefitter or an electrician don’t diminish.”Courts have not been sympathetic to claims that discrimination is being cloaked in credit checks, said Angela Onwuachi-Willig, a law professor at the University of Iowa. “At what point does the fact that someone lives in a particular neighborhood or someone has a bad credit score become a way of eliminating people for illegal grounds?” she asked rhetorically. “Basically, the courts don’t protect against proxy discrimination.”Stuart J. Ishimaru, the acting chairman of the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, said the commission would probably issue guidance on the proper use of credit checks. Such guidance, though nonbinding, could offer some reassurance against lawsuits to employers who comply.“It’s something that intrigues us and worries us,” Mr. Ishimaru said, adding that some job-related tests had led to discrimination claims in the past. “The question is, why do you use it? How is this a good screening device?”CNBC SlideshowsBiggest Welfare StatesBest States for Green JobsRecession-Resistant CitiesFederal law requires employers to get the consent of job applicants before running credit checks, said Pamela Q. Devata, a lawyer in the Chicago office of Seyfarth Shaw.And if they are considering denying someone a job based on a check, she said, “they have to notify the applicant.” That is intended to give someone a chance to explain circumstances or spot erroneous information.When the job market improves and fewer people are fighting for slots, credit histories may become less important, said Michael C. Lazarchick, a career counselor in Pleasantville, N.J. “But these are lean and mean times.”"
2009-08-20,French Work the Least in the World: Survey,0.031818181818181815,"The French spend the least amount of time at work, a new survey of 73 cities around the world by Swiss bank UBS shows, while the most hours are worked in Cairo and Seoul.On average, people in the cities surveyed worked 1,902 hours per year, but in Lyon and Paris they worked 1,582 and 1,594 hours respectively. In Cairo, they worked 2,373 hours, while in Seoul they worked 2,312 hours.The richest workers are in New York and Zurich, where they would have to work nine hours to buy an iPod nano, while workers in Mumbai needed to work 20 nine-hour days – nearly one month's salary – to buy the gadget.Copenhagen, Zurich, Geneva and New York were the cities where employees had the highest gross wages. In terms of the most expensive cities, London fell from the top of the list to the 21st place because of the pound's devaluation, the survey showed.Oslo is the world's most expensive city now, followed by Zurich, Copenhagen, Geneva and Tokyo, while New York was on the list at number 6.

2009-09-15,Market Tips: Dollar Outlook is Grim ,-0.10112007168458781,"In the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the U.S. dollar saw widespread declines as the Federal Reserve was forced to slash interest rates to eventually zero. Since then there has been growing speculation that the greenback may not hold on to its status as the world’s reserve currency and faces more declines.  Near-Term Outlook Remains Grim“Near-term it does look pretty tough for the dollar … rates being so low in the US in response to the crisis, that really hurts the dollar, which is used to having a least some yield premium over the Japanese yen for instance,” Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac Bank, told CNBC. “A pretty grim picture until we get a lot better news on the economy and at this stage it doesn’t seem time yet,” Callow added. Will There Be a Dollar Crisis?“Over the long term you expect the US dollar will remain relatively weak,” Jim Vrondas, manager of corporate business at OzForex, told CNBC. “It’s going to take a long time to unwind these massive deficits that they’ve got going on at the moment and in that kind of environment it’s only naturally that people become a little bit hesitant of holding dollar reserves,” he said. Recovery Still A Few Years AwayJohn Licata, chief investment strategist at Blue Phoenix, says that while the progress over the last 12 months had not been as dramatic as expected, the financial crisis has increased investor awareness. Greed Has ReturnedThe lessons of the past year have been forgotten and risk appetite has returned dramatically on Wall Street, says Richard Bove, financial strategist at Rochdale Securities.US has Not Learned from CrisisThe U.S. has not learnt anything and without dealing with the economy's core structural problems, the malaise will continue, says Damon Vickers, CIO at Nine Points Capital Partners. Credit Crisis is Receding: AnalystThe credit crisis is receding, notes Sean Fenton, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners. He offers his take on how markets will fare going forward."
2009-09-25,Off to a Rocky Start,0.02807720057720057,"S&P 500 futures drop about 6 points as August durable good orders were well below expectations: down 2.4 percent vs. consensus of up 0.4 percent. The dollar rallied, as it did yesterday on the disappointing existing home sales report. Elsewhere: 1) KB Home down 5 percent despite posting a narrower-than-expected Q3 loss as better margins and smaller writedowns. The homebuilder's revenues fell 33 percent as home deliveries fell 20 percent and average prices declined 15 percent. However, new orders soared 62 percent from the year-ago quarter, but were down 27 percent sequentially from the prior quarter. Weighing on the shares is CEO Jeff Mezger's cautious comments: ""it will likely be some time before we see meaningful improvement in the economic conditions that are essential to our industry's future growth."" 2) Sara Lee rises 7 percent pre-open after Unilever agreed to buy its soap and personal care units for $1.9 billion dollars. The acquisition allows Unilever to diversify its portfolio of consumer product brands, while the deal will help Sara Lee repurchase $1 billion in stock and ""invest for growth"" in core businesses. The companies expect the deal to close next year. 3) Another IPO: The busy week for IPOs continues today. Shanda Games (GAME) priced its Nasdaq-listed shares at $12.50 - at the high end of the previously announced range of $10.50-$12.50. The Chinese online video game operator raised $1 billion and becomes the biggest IPO in the U.S. this year. 4) We're growing, but not as much as you wanted. Hewlett Packard down 1 percent pre-open as CEO Mark Hurd said the magic words: ""We expect the IT industry to return to growth in 2010 and believe that HP will outpace the market,"" but their guidance was not as strong as expected. Diluted EPS in the range of $4.20 to $4.30 was near analyst estimates of $4.23, while revenue of approximately $117.0 billion to $118.0 billion is below consensus of $118 billion. 5) Airlines trading up about 2 percent pre-open as UBS upgrades airlines including AMR , Continental, US Air, with United its top pick. UBS says that ""Thanks to the recent flurry of capital raises the balance sheets of several of US airlines will be flush with new cash."" 6) Goldman Sachs upgrades refining sectorm including Holly, Occidental  and Sunoco. 7) The two-day decline in stocks (less than 2 percent on the S&P 500), has some again wondering about the long-sought correction. Bears point out that we have moved over 50 percent since the March lows and are due for a correction, but Laszlo Birinyi (quoted in Morningstar) notes that there is little evidence for an imminent correction: ""Give me the evidence...in 1982 we went 424 days before we had a correction. In 2000, we went seven years before we had a 10% correction. In 2002, we went three or four years."" 8) Short interest continues to decrease. Traders have bitterly complained that shorting the market has been a recipe for disaster in the past several months; many have told me they have been shorting much less. We continue to get evidence that shorting is indeed down. From August 31st to September 15th, the total amount of securities on the S&P 500 sold short dropped by 7.3 percent. _____________________________The Dow 30 in Real TimeThe CNBC Stock Blog_____________________________Questions?  Comments?  tradertalk@cnbc.com"
2009-10-22,Halftime Report: Watch Goldman Action Closely Into Close,0.14317982783500022,"Stocks were searching for direction on Thursday with investors digesting generally positive earnings reports versus not so positive economic news.Among the Dow components 3M, Travelers  and McDonald's  all posted solid results suggesting strength, however, the number of workers filing new jobless claims rose by 11,000 last week, indicating the labor market remains fragile.Adding to the negative tone, one day earlier, widely followed bank analyst Dick Bove cut his view of Wells Fargo saying loan losses were mounting. However Wells along with Goldman  and other banks shrugged off the negative comments and trended higher.How should you be positioned?Instant Insights with the Fast Money tradersIt seems to me investors are digesting the harsh sell-off that followed Bove’s comments, muses OptionMonster Jon Najarian. Personally, I think it’s positive that the S&P has stabilized at this level. And I’m watching Goldman closely, he adds.   Positive momentum in Goldman shares could be a ‘tell’ for the market overall. Into the close, if Goldman goes up, I think the market goes up. Follow the money.It seems to me resistance at these levels is strong, muses Mike Gurka of Empower. By and large earnings have been beating expectations. With trim payrolls and lower inventories the future may look brighter for Corporate America.I’m watching the December S&P contract, explains Greg Troccoli of Opalesque. Any close below 1071 and I would sell the S&P outright and take a short position. As for Goldman, I would not be a buyer at these levels. The stock has almost quadrupled since last November. I think upside is limited. In the banking space I’m watching Capital One, adds Jim Strugger of MKM. Around 37.50, I’d take a shot with a 38- strike call in November.TAKE YOUR POSITION: MICROSOFTTech investors are keeping a close eye on Microsoft Thursday. The software giant reports earnings on Friday before the bell. Ahead of the results, the company launched Windows 7 OS, its most important release for more than a decade, aiming to win back customers after the disappointing Vista and strengthen its grip on the PC market.The success of Windows -- which accounts for more than half of Microsoft's profit -- is crucial for Chief Executive Steve Ballmer to revive the company's image as the world's most important software firmWhat’s the trade?I think over the long run Windows 7 will do well, muses Mike Gurka. But on the day-to-day side of trading, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the market anticipate a pullback in this stock.I would buy Microsoft on weakness, counsels Jon Najarian. And I’d take a look at Hewlett Packard as a beneficiary of Windows 7.-------WITH OIL AT $80 TIME TO BUY?Oil slipped below $81 on Thursday as a stronger dollar encouraged investors to lock into profits from a 12-month high hit the previous day.On Wednesday, U.S. crude surged to $82, the highest price since October last year, as weekly U.S. government oil data showed a large drop in gasoline inventories over the last week and fuel demand rising about 4 percent year-on-year.It's also important to note that many analysts think the oil trade is more about the dollar right now than supply and demand.It is becoming almost imperative to trade the commodity markets from the perspective of the dollar these days, as nothing else seems to count for very much, MF Global wrote in a research note.What’s the trade?I’m a buyer, says Greg Troccoli.

2009-10-30,Halftime Report: Technical Break Could Signal S&P 950,-0.049603174603174566,"On the last trading day of the month, the Dow and S&P turned sharply lower around lunchtime with investors eager to move to the sidelines.Negative sentiment seemed to prevail after a Labor Department report showed personal spending dipped 0.5 percent in September, while personal income was flat.Those figures again turned attention to the fragile state of the consumer – which is considered vital to a recovery because consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of all U.S. economic activity.Also the dollar  turned higher. Lately the greenback has had an inverse impact on equities.On the final trading day of the month, the S&P 500 was down 0.99 percent for October. If the index is unable to hold onto the month's gains, it will snap a seven-month winning streakWhat should you be watching?I think we’re looking at more of a psychological phenomenon in the market than anything else, says Steve Grasso of Stuart Frankel. This is the last day of the fiscal year for most mutual funds. Usually we see losses in October and this time we’ve had gains. So money managers are locking in profits on the last day of the month. But that doesn’t change the fact stocks are selling off. I’m watching 1042 on the S&P, he adds. If we close below that level, technically we open the door to S&P 1000.I think the action is absolutely horrible, adds Joe Terranova. Technically it looks awful. If the E-Mini S&P futures break below 3700 I think we may have an ugly close.Warren Buffett often says be fearful when other are greedy and greedy when other are fearful. I ‘do’ think you can dip your toe into best of breed names, especially in commodities, he adds. But only do it knowing that declines are coming from professional investors who are moving to the sidelines because they are fearful of what they’re seeing in the market.The S&P hit my big upside target of 1100, adds Bill Strazzullo of Bell Curve. I think we could be putting in an intermediate top. If you’re long I’d be talking profits. And if you’re a speculator, I also think you can be aggressive on the short side. Patterns in the S&P suggest to me that 1030 is a critical level. If we break that then I think we move down to 1000. And the move down could be as steep as 950 after that.I watch volatility and it’s clearly returning to the market, adds Brian Stutland of Stutland Equities. If the Vix  closes above 28 I’d be a buyer of volatility and prepare for swings in the market.-------FINANCIALS LEADING MARKET LOWERFinancials led the market lower on Friday after the economic data mentioned above renewed concerns about the public’s ability to make mortgages and credit card payments.What’s the trade?Since JPMorgan released earnings, the financials haven’t done much, explains Joe Terranova. The only stock in the space I’d consider is Goldman. Around $170, I’d consider buying. But I have to admit I'm long Goldman and I’m nervous.I’m watching BofA, says Brian Stutland. I’m a buyer of the November 6/17.5 call spread.-------DOLLAR REBOUNDINGThe U.S. dollar made gains on Friday after steep losses in the previous session as investors turned to the greenback as a safe-haven amid Friday’s sharp sell-off.""We're seeing some weakness in equities probably due to some month-end selling and that pushed the dollar higher,"" explains Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at TD Securities.Also, since the dollar sold off most of the month, fund managers may need to buy back the dolar to maintain hedge ratios at the end of the month.Meanwhile, the stronger dollar dragged down the price of crude  with investors also growing concerned that the recent pop may be ahead of supply and demand fundamentals.What’s the trade?I think the correlation between stronger dollar and weaker market is overdone, says Dennis Gartman. Germany has a stronger currency and a stronger market. I think dollar weakness is probably presenting an opportunity for dipping a toe into best of breed names, especially in commodities, says Joe Terranova. But do it knowing that declines are coming from professional investors moving to the sidelines because they are fearful of what they’re seeing in the market.-------CALL THE CLOSEJoe Terranova: I’d move the sidelinesSteve Grasso: I’m a seller. I don’t like the feelBill Strazzullo: I’m short and staying short.______________________________________________________Got something to to say?

2010-01-28,Steel Standing?,-0.04039039039039039,"Tonight, Cramer talks with Dan DiMicco, the CEO of Nucor  about the state of the steel industry. With the Chinese putting the brakes on their economy and the lack of domestic orders here in the US, ""the steel business seems to be stuck between a rock and a hard place, even as steel prices rise around the world,"" Cramer said.NUE reported a better than expected fourth quarter yesterday, but compared to a year ago things look rather dreary. The company’s average sales price per ton is down 35% year over year, total tons shipped to outside customers down 9% year over year and steel mill capacity utilization was at a historically low 54%.Cramer has liked Nucor for its 3.4% dividend yield and last recommended it on December 23 at $46. The stock is down 8% since then, but investors have made a considerable amount of money over the long-term, returning 241% to shareholders over the past ten years or 297% if you reinvested the dividend. And within the same period, the S&P 500 was down 24%. This is looking like a difficult time in the steel industry. DiMicco himself has said that the recovery will be long and slow, especially with the employment picture so bleak and the Obama administration not doing enough to create jobs here in America. Cramer said this is something that’s become even more important now that the Chinese are slowing down their overheated economy. So, is there a future for the steel industry? And why are earnings anemic despite all of the price increases? And can Dan DiMicco, who met with the President multiple times on these issues, give any behind the scenes input? To answer those questions and more Cramer welcomed back the CEO of Nucor, Dan DiMicco. Watch the video for the full interview.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

2010-02-03,Denny's: No Such Thing as a Free Lunch? Think Again.,0.21626984126984128,"Main Street's slow economic recovery has one restaurant chain handing out a free meal to its customers...again.Denny's, a family-style franchise, is giving away a free 'Original Grand Slam' meal, which includes two eggs, two sausages links, two strips of bacon and two pancakes, on Tuesday, Feb. 9, as a way to give back to his customers who are still facing economic hardships, Nelson Marchioli, the CEO of the Denny's franchise, told CNBC Wednesday. ""My belief is we are still suffering, my customer is still suffering in this economy. They are the ones who have lost jobs, they are the ones who have lost their homes,"" said Marchioli. ""Wall Street may be in recovery; Main Street is not in my opinion.""Marchioli said more than 40 percent of Denny's customers are blue collar workers who earn $45,000 or less in household income. The company started the free Grand Slam Meal program last year as a part of its marketing strategy. About two million took advantage of the Denny's free meal in 2009, Marchioli said.Denny's will be promoting the free meal deal in a Superbowl commercial on Sunday, Feb. 7."
2010-03-04,Ads Posted on Facebook Strike Some as Off-Key,0.16044210708273207,"Facebook, the world’s biggest social network, is selling more ad spots to big companies like Wal-Mart Stores, Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo.But the site’s pages are also home to countless ads from smaller companies that can be funny, weird or just plain creepy — those suggesting you are, say, eligible to get a free iPad because you are exactly 26 years old, or entreaties to see what your offspring would look like if you had a child with a celebrity.Odd Web ads, like the dancing women promoting mortgage brokers, are not new. But on social networks like Facebook, where people go to communicate with one another, advertisers seem to be trying especially hard to intrude on the conversation.The so-called self-service ads on the site, from the likes of video game start-ups, herbal supplement makers, sweepstakes companies and wedding photographers, are shown on the right side of most pages. Many advertisers who use the self-service system are tempted to go as far as possible in making ads that attract attention and appear relevant, aided by the information that people give to Facebook.“When it works, it’s amazingly impactful, but when it doesn’t work, it’s not only creepy but off-putting,” said Tim Hanlon, a principal at the consulting firm Riverview Lane Associates of Chicago. “What a marketer might think is endearing, by knowing a little bit about you, actually crosses the line pretty easily.”One campaign that flooded the site in recent weeks, before Facebook cracked down on it, tries to take advantage of consumer interest in Apple’s iPad. “Are you a fan of Eddie Izzard? We need 100 music and movie lovers to test and KEEP the new Apple iPad,” one version of the ad says. Louis Allred Jr., 29, a Facebook user in Los Angeles who saw the ad, said he figured it was shown to him because he or a friend had expressed enthusiasm for Mr. Izzard, a British comedian, on their profiles.“It doesn’t seem like they are using the information in sensible ways,” Mr. Allred said.Mr. Allred was also skeptical about the test-an-iPad offer. The ad sends people to Prize-Rewards.net, a site that appears to be based in Vancouver, Canada, and tries to get people to pursue rewards by signing up for memberships in services like Netflix. Efforts to reach the company were unsuccessful.Dan Rose, vice president for business development at Facebook, compared the company’s self-service ad platform to the early versions of Google’s highly profitable AdWords system. He predicted that the quality of the promotional messages on the site would improve as more companies began to use it.“A year ago, we had lower-quality ads, and a year from now we will have higher-quality ads,” Mr. Rose said. “It’s early, but we have made a lot of progress.”The self-service ad system offers any person or company the opportunity to quickly design an ad and aim it toward finely segmented groups of Facebook’s 400 million members, based on gender, age, location and preferences like favorite movies and activities.For example, a promoter can advertise tickets to a band’s concert to the select group of Facebook users who live in the area and have mentioned that band on their profile page or status updates. Or a wedding photographer can show ads only to people in a certain city who have switched their relationship status to “engaged.”“I’ve had good success with it on a limited budget,” said Carter Rose, a wedding photographer in Dallas who has paid $1,700 for Facebook ads over the last few months and as a result booked three weddings at $3,500 each.Many advertisers view a site like Facebook as a good place for playful messages. Cordarounds, a San Francisco pants company, talks about “pigeon matadors” and “trouserbots” that make pants in a “zero-G environment” to capture attention for its products on Facebook.“It’s a conversational medium. If you can be the originator of that conversation, you are fitting in,” said Chris Lindland, the company’s chief executive, who uses Facebook to advertise solely to young men in the 20 largest urban areas.From the perspective of many users, the tailored ads can often seem, at best, presumptuous.Women who change their status to “engaged” on Facebook to share the news with their friends, for example, report seeing a flood of advertisements for services and products like wedding photographers, skin treatments and weight-loss regimens.Then there are the nonsensical ads, which highlight the fact that Facebook does not have employees to review each ad, but relies largely on member feedback to flag inappropriate messages. That allows ads to slip through that run afoul of the company’s policies. “Laws now allow U.S. residents to reduce their credit card debt by more than 50 percent,” reads one ad for a debt-relief Web site, which is accompanied by a surreal image of four tiny babies lying in the palm of a hand.“It caught my eye, but it sure didn’t win my trust,” said Paige Kobert, 32, an advertising employee from San Francisco who saw the ad recently. “It just seemed like a scam.”A Facebook spokesman, Brandon McCormick, said ads like that one and the Eddie Izzard iPad ad violated a Facebook policy that requires the text and photo in the ad to be related to what is being advertised.Mr. McCormick said that in the last few weeks, Facebook had begun enforcing that provision after users complained about the flood of ads aimed at alumni from a certain university or people of a certain age (“Hey, 32-Year-Olds”), with messages that had nothing to do with those characteristics.Such ads are the equivalent of a direct mail “special offer for John Smith” that turns out to be not so special.Facebook users seem most perplexed when they are left wondering why they have received a customized ad.Jess Walker, 22, from central Florida, was recently presented an ad for Plan B, the morning-after pill.“What do I have on my Facebook page that would lead them to believe I would need that?” she asked, adding that she did not want her sexual behavior called into question.Ms. Walker noted that Facebook allowed her to delete the ad from the page she was viewing. — which would then make Facebook less likely to allow that particular ad to be sent to other people.Mr. Rose from Facebook said the ads on the site were becoming more professional and straightforward as the company updated its policies and enforced them.“When you have got the platform that we have, you are naturally going to attract people who are going to game it,” Mr. Rose said.Tech Check with Jim Goldman"
2010-03-19,CEO Blog: Our Greatest New Threat,0.18333869949494952,"I’m an engineer. I identify a problem and develop a solution. I’d like to think that the success of companies like Dyson – based in the UK– have helped the country in more than a few ways, including boosting its exports and tax revenues. Whether at home or abroad, politicians don’t really need me to identify new problems – they have enough of those. But where can I match my passion for a cause with some constructive ideas? I think it’s worth talking about. Here’s the problem.Both the US and UK economies rely too heavily on selling services. Financial services in particular, as the last two years have shown very dramatically. We all know that many products can be made cheaper and faster overseas. But now the large manufacturers such as China, India and South Korea are moving up the value chain. The threat is no longer low-cost manufacturing; it’s high-tech and ideas. And the proof? As of this year, China has overtaken Germany as the world’s biggest exporter. And it’s not limited to less expensive products. So, why have I decided on now to bang the drum? Well, now is the opportunity for change: we’re coming out of recession; our service-dependency has hurt us badly; and in the UK, there’s nothing like an election year to focus the minds of those who can change things. In the UK, I’ve just produced a reportto help shape politicians’ thinking. The Conservatives have backed it and I’m hoping others will take my ideas on board. It’s about inspiring, supporting and investing to make best use of some superb resources already at our disposal. It’s not, however, about a quick fix, having an idea is easy, but making it work takes time. The UK has a highly motivated workforce; the universities and academics are fantastic. We don’t always make the most of these - of which science and engineering are at the heart. I hope some of the ideas in Ingenious Britaincan be explored in the United States, too – as a society, a greater understanding of the importance of engineering; and a commitment to programs that excite students about science, math and technology. From primary school pupils to graduates, teachers to government, we need more people to take up science, engineering and design. These are exciting and rewarding careers which can contribute hugely to our society and our economy. Government needs to take the lead in steering our brightest and best in this direction. Educators should look again at how universities are funded and assessed. These places need the freedom and flexibility to identify what students and industry wants – such as shorter courses with industry experience. Potential science and engineering undergraduates need more access to industrial scholarships. Student loans might be written off. Postgraduates should be paid properly for their research. Further down the line, access to capital is crucial. Government must examine better routes for debt financing to reach high tech companies. If possible, this should involve using the power of government guarantees to encourage lenders – existing banks or new entrants – to extend credit to innovative small businesses. Once properly up and running, companies – both small and large – need more significant tax credits for research and development. In the UK, these should be increased by as much as a third to 200%. Such a move could have a huge impact on a company’s investment decisions and would send a clear signal to business leaders about the government’s belief in science and technology. And what do I know, apart from making vacuum cleaners? Well, Dyson’s about a bit more than that these days. We make all sorts of new technology – fans, digital motors and more in the pipeline. That’s the point about R&D: we’re constantly looking at new inventions for the long term. When it comes to major UK companies filing patents, only Rolls-Royce is ahead of us. We also know a bit about selling overseas: eight out of ten of our machines are exported. They reach 49 countries, with the US being our biggest market. There’s no doubt that production in Malaysia has helped us to expand faster – we employ more than 1,200 people in the UK, 300 in the US and 2,500 globally. Dyson was built from scratch over 30 years. Parts of that time were slow and painful, but I know that the pace was quickened by employing graduates with the right skills and investing in R&D. We need to make it much easier for other businesses to do the same.

2010-04-07,Fliers Beware: More Fees for What Used to Be Free ,0.07848484848484846,"Airlines are now touting their summer fares to lure travelers. But they are also introducing a slate of fees for items and services that used to be free, including SpiritAirlines’ new policy of charging up to $45 for one oversize carry-on bag.Ben Baldanza, president and CEO of Spirit told CNBC Wednesday that at the same time the company insituted the carry-on bag fee, it also lowered fares and checked-bag costs. As a result, he said, “Sales are up 50 percent.”  Spirit passengers are still allowed one carry-on for free, as long as the luggage fits under the seat in front of them. It's when the bag must go into the overhead bin that the fee is charged. The $45 fee applies at the gate; passengers are charged $15 less for the carry-on if they pay online or at the airport check-in counter.Most airlines charge between $20 and $30 for checked bags and allow two free carry-ons. As Reuters reported Wednesday, the airlines been shoring up their nearly bare coffers by introducing auxiliary sources of revenue by charging customers for items and services, while also cutting capacity and adjusting their business models; in the last few years, the industry has been hammered by the combination of unpredictable fuel prices, a poor economy that has hindered travel and competition from budget carriers.Spirit isn't the only airline getting more money from passengers: Travelers on other airlines now pay for in-flight blankets and pillows and even as much as $75 for an extra-legroom seat on a cross-country flight. As outrageous as it sounds, Ryanair, a budget European carrier, has revived its much-debated plan to charge for a trip to the restroom by using coin-operated toilets. JetBlue still gives you a free bag of blue potato chips, but it now charges for other perks, including, for April only at this point, whopping fees for extra-legroom seats. For a San Francisco to New York flight, for instance, more legroom will cost you $75 each way. According to JetBlue, the airline is trying the fee structure to gauge demand and determine whether to replace the longstanding fees of between $10 and $40 per flight. Here’s a sampling of other fees charged by airlines: Pillow and blanket, American, $8 Wi-Fi, through gogoinflight.com, $4.99 for 1.5 hours to $39.95 for a 30-day unlimited pass good for multiple airlines that include AirTran , American, Delta and Virgin America. “Deluxe” sandwich, $10, JetBlueHeadsets, $2, JetBlueFor a list of domestic baggage fees, check out airfarewatchdog.com’s chart (you can see it here).

2010-05-19,"Wednesday Look Ahead: Watch the Financials, Euro",0.0900947817614484,"The financial sector will be at the crux of market worries Wednesday, as the U.S. Senate moves closer to a vote on banking reform and German regulators explain their surprise move to ban naked short-selling on a group of bank stocks and sovereign debt.Investors are looking for clarity on Germany's late day move Tuesday to ban naked short selling in the shares of 10 German financial institutions and in euro zone sovereign debt. The ban, which took effect at midnight, would also apply to credit default swaps based on those bonds. German officials hold a press briefing on the ban Wednesday.As news of the rules slipped out during the early afternoon in New York, the euro went into a dive, taking risk assets, like stocks and oil with it. The euro  fell to a fresh four-year low against the dollar, touching $1.2161 before finishing at $1.2213. Oil fell nearly 1 percent to $69.41, its lowest close since last September.The Dow finished down 114 points at 10,510, after being up as much as 93 points on the day. The S&P 500 fell 15 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1120.Euro Trashed""The measures today were missing the forest for the trees,"" said David Gilmore of Foreign Exchange Analytics. ""Really all they do is channel more of the market risk takers into expressing their negative view on the euro zone into the currency.""""It says a lot of why the euro went to a new four-year low today, and that was after spending most of the day strengthening and squeezing out short positions. In any crisis, there's always going to be policy mistakes. Some of the mistakes are going to be bigger than others. This has the potential to be quite big. It may not be a Lehman mistake, but it's right up there,"" he said.However, Stephen Stanley, chief economist with Pierpont Securities, said he doesn't believe the moves will make that much of a difference unless other countries join Germany. ""From what I read, it looks like it's really mostly symbolic. They clearly have the ability and authority to prevent short selling on those German stocks, but I don't think this has much teeth when it comes to euro bonds and CDS... Much more of those trade in London than in Germany,"" he said.Goldman Sachs' European economists, meanwhile, said they believe the move was made by German officials to make the expected passage of the $440 billion euro bailout package Friday more palatable to the German parliament. They also say they expect other countries to follow Germany's lead.The new rules are valid until next March 31, and it appears to have some exemptions for market makers who need to hedge.The news leaked out after European markets were closed, but it rattled U.S. investors who remembered U.S. regulators banning short selling in financial stocks during the thick of the financial crisis.""What bothers people here, in as much as it smacks of desperation, is when we got to the stage where we were eliminating short selling, we were in deep, deep trouble. I wouldn't have thought the situation was so dire over there to take those actions. It's pretty clear policy makers are out of control, and they're flailing around. That's not going to make the euro stop going down,"" said Barry Knapp, head of U.S. equities strategy at Barclays Capital.Fin RegCongressional efforts to enact financial regulatory reform legislation has been a long process, and now that the Senate moves toward a potential vote later this week, the market is taking more notice. The S&P financial sector was down nearly 2.8 percent Tuesday, giving it a 7.8 percent decline this month.""I don't think people had really done the analysis on this, and all of the sudden, we're at the verge of it, and now people are putting pen to paper and they're saying 'wow,' he said. Knapp said if rules similar to Basile III capital standards were applied to U.S. banks, the top 20 banks would need an additional $160 billion in capital.More From CNBC.com:Slideshow: The World's Biggest Debtor NationsGovernment Debt Issuers Most Likely to DefaultEven after the Senate approves a bill, the final shape of legislation will still be unclear. The Senate bill will have to be reconciled with a bill passed previously by the House of Representatives.""It all adds up to the same thing, which is a pretty big hit to the forward earnings outlook. It is also unclear for what it means for credit creation and the economy,"" he said.""The problem with fin reg here is if you get a vote on, let's say Thursday night, you've got headline risk the day before an (options) expiration. Just from a market perspective, that's added a level of complexity. That's just not what traders want to deal with,"" Knapp said. Goldman Sachs analysts Monday issued a report saying the proposals so far in the regulatory reform bill present about 20 percent risk to normalized earnings per share for banks. They also said the moves in CDS and options markets imply the stocks of financials may be about 6 percent too expensive.Widely followed bank analyst Meredith Whitney also Monday said that she would avoid the group, as regulatory reform will dent their earnings and restrict lending.On Tuesday, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. made moves to compromise on a key and controversial feature of the Senate bill which would force banks to spin off their swaps desk. Dodd suggested a proposal to delay any ban on bank derivatives operations for two years while federal regulators study the potential impact. But Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., who proposed the rule said she would fight any effort to weaken it.What Else to WatchConsumer price index inflation data is released at 8:30 a.m., and minutes of the Fed's last meeting will be released at 2 p.m. Stanley said the market more likely than not will brush off the Fed minutes. ""The meeting was before the European stuff came to a head...It's pretty clear to me that the Fed reaction in all of this has been pretty cautious and aggressive, opening up swap lines again and the rhetoric..It takes teeth out of any hawkish noise coming out of those minutes. People will dismiss it as old news. If it's dovish, people could say, 'geez, if they were dovish before all this happened, where are they now?'"" he said.Stanley said he had been expecting the Fed to move toward a tighter monetary policy by September, but now thinks the Fed will wait until next year because of the European situation.Hewlett-Packard, meanwhile, may get some focus after it reported better-than-expected earnings and raised its full year outlook after Tuesday's bell. The company earned $2.2 billion on revenues of $30.8 billion. Earnings Wednesday include Target ,Limited Brands , and Polo Ralph Lauren .Knapp pointed to the decline in consumer discretionary stocks Tuesday, even after some good retail earnings.""This is the stage in the economic cycle where you would expect consumer discretionary would have been a big winner, and it's not trading particularly well... Some of it's cyclical rotation..but I'm not so sure I want to say it's a bad sign about the economy. It does tell you there were a lot of people in the trade. You put all these things together -- You have fin reg. You have the euro going down and you have retailers not responding to good earnings and that's making for a pretty good drubbing I suppose,"" said Knapp.Who Dunnit?The SEC and CFTC still don't know what caused the market plunge May 6, but they will continue to study it and they have six scenarios they are pursuing.  Those include a mismatch in liquidity, disparate trading rules, and linkages between the decline in stock index products such as index ETFs and the e-mini S&P 500 futures.They did say they found no evidence of a fat finger trade, computer hacking or terrorist activity but they could not completely rule out those possibilities either.  The SEC issued new rules on single stock circuit breakers, where it would require a five minute trading halt if the price declines by 10 percent in a five minute period.

2010-07-08,Halftime Pt. 2—Four Strong Fundamentals Plays,0.12382319434951017,"In a market with such unclear trends and extreme volatility, many investors are going back to the basics and looking at the fundamentals of individual stocks. We tapped our Fast Money traders for their best plays.Patty Edwards of Storehouse Partners likes Arrow Electronics . It is trading at seven times forward earnings, where in the past five years, it has traded at twelve times. With General Motors continuing production this summer, Edwards doesn't think manufacturing is dead. Steve Grasso of Stuart Frankel is going with tobacco stocks. He recently bought Altria Group , but because of high dividend yields, recommends Lorillard and Reynolds American .The utility space is where Brian Kelly of Kanundrum Capital is turning. He likes Dominion Resources'  4.7% dividend yield. If you overwrite it by way of a covered call strategy, he thinks you could boost the yield up to 6%. Guy Adami of Drakon Capital is going with IBM . He says they have a great balance sheet and a lot of cash on-hand.---CALL OF THE DAY: DARE GO AGAINST WARREN BUFFETT?Stifel Nicolaus downgraded Berkshire Hathaway  from 'hold' to 'sell' Thursday. But why challenge Warren Buffett and sell now?Try macroeconomic conditions, says analyst Meyer Shields while on Thursday's Fast Money Halftime Report. He says until consumers start spending again, which depends on unemployment, Berkshire's exposure to the US economy is going to suffer.Brian Kelly of Kanundrum Capital points out that there are two valuations for Berkshire—one for the company itself and another for Buffett's holdings. Shields says Buffett's valuation is particularily valuable during times of crisis. His returns on General Electric  and Goldman Sachs  were, in part, simply thanks ot his imprimatur on their continued viability. If Buffett were to retire, he thinks it would negatively impact those stocks.Shields says Berkshire is not a value to buy right now, adding that it's inflated due to fixed income securities are benefitting from low interest rates.What's the Trade? The downgrade of Berkshire is a market call, says Guy Adami of Drakon Capital, so he thinks the market overall could go lower. Steve Grasso of Stuart Frankel agrees, also predicting the markets could continue to decline.---CALL TO THE FLOOR: TRADING HEALTH CAREShares of kidney dialysis provider DaVita is coming off of its 52-week high, which it hit last month. The Denver-based company is facing several headwinds could make or break the stock's performance.Speaking on Thursday's Fast Money Halftime Report, CEO Kent Thiry says federal government deficits is his biggest concern. The bigger the deficits, he says, the more lawmakers look at cutting spending and often times, they cut Medicare. That's worrisome for Thiry because 82% of DaVita's patients are on Medicare.Watch the video to see the complete conversation with Thiry, including his comments on health care reform.---LEBRON WATCHA free agent, NBA standout LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers, is scheduled to announce where he plans to play in an one-hour television special Thursday night.Last week, James met with the Cavs, Miami Heat, New Jersey Nets, New York Knicks, Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Clippers. Knicks fans and investors of Madison Square Garden  alike are hoping James is in a ""New York State of Mind,"" which brings us to Thursday's Fast Money Poll—Is MSG a buy on possibility of Knicks acquiring LeBron?---CALL THE CLOSEBrian Kelly of Kanundrum Capital is still a seller of the market. ""I'm staying in for now,"" says Patty Edwards of Storehouse Partners. ""But I think it's a short-term call."" Also a seller of the market, Steve Grasso of Stuart Frankel is hiding in tobacco stocks. Guy Adami of Drakon Capital is also a seller.______________________________________________________Got something to to say?

2010-07-15,Google Earnings Fall Short of Expectations,0.059193141088302384,"Googleshares dropped sharply in extended trading Thursday after the company reported a profit that failed to match what Wall Street hoped was coming, after a spike in expenses offset a 24 percent revenue jump.The report marked a rare stumble for a company accustomed to shattering financial expectations.Google, which is expanding into new products and markets in hopes of maintaining the growth momentum Wall Street also looks for, spent heavily on research and development and hired aggressively.Some analysts said headwinds from weakening foreign currency did not hurt revenue growth as much as anticipated, as Google managed to surpass targets for net revenue.""They're throwing more money into R&D than people were expecting and a little bit less into sales and marketing,"" said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis. ""Google has been pretty clear that it's going back into investment mode. They added 1,200 people in the quarter, which means more expenses are going to kick in in September.""The Internet search and advertising giant said it earned $6.45 a share in the second quarter excluding one-time items, up from $5.36 a share last year.Excluding traffic-acquisition costs (TAC), Google's revenue reached $5.1 billion in the most recent period, up from $4.073 billion last year.A group of 36 equity analysts who follow Google expected on average for the company to report a profit of $6.51 a share and revenue, excluding TAC, of $4.985 billion.Google shares dropped more than 4 percent in extended trading Thursday. Get after-hour quotes for Google here.The stock finished Thursday's regular Nasdaq session  up less than 1 percent at $494.02.""It missed my non-GAAP estimates but revenues looked a little better than expected,"" Aaron Kessler, an analyst with Thinkequity, told Reuters. ""Research and development looked pretty high and general and administrative expenses were higher than I was expecting. Operating expenses overq;Ihigher than we had estimated which dragged down the earnings per share.""Payroll BallooningGoogle has beaten Wall Street revenue expectations in five of the past seven quarters and exceeded profit estimates in each of the past seven.Its shares sold off after its last two better-than-expected earnings reports when, analysts said, some investors' expectations of blow-out results were missed. Thursday's results were a rare outright earnings miss.Google is increasingly pitting itself against rivals beyond its usual competitors Yahoo and Microsoft, as it ventures into smartphone operating systems, mobile advertising and other areas in search of future growth.Google, which has made a string of acquistions in recent months, added more than 1,100 employees to its payroll during the second quarter.Google's net earnings came in at $1.84 billion, or $5.71 per share, in the three months ending in June. That was up 24 percent from the same time last year, but lower than the rate of growth in the first three months of the year.Total revenue, including money that Google shares with Web site partners, was $6.82 billion in the quarter.In an encouraging sign for the overall economy, marketers paid more for the online ads that generate virtually all of Google's income. People also clicked on the ads more frequently.Those trends indicate more companies and shoppers are feeling a little better as they recover from the worst economic downturn in more than 70 years.- AP contributed to this report."

2010-07-26,Cramer’s Top 6 Comeback Stocks for 2010,0.12030035483839834,"Down big in the first half of the year, up big in the second – that is Cramer’s latest investing thesis.The Mad Money host found a number of stocks, culled from the S&P 500’s worst-performing sectors, that he thinks offers a tremendous amount of snapback potential. One of them, in fact, has lost almost half its value so far in 2010, but Cramer said it could end up being one of the best stocks to own over the next six months. The others, whose loses may not be as severe, still stand up as very attractive buys for the rest of the year, Cramer said. Investors who agree with him probably want to buy in now, as these picks won’t stay secret for long.Read on for the Top 6 Comeback Stocks of 2010.Posted 26 July 2010When Cramer highlighted Verizon on July 12, the stock had fallen 15% over the first six months of 2010. They may come as little surprise given that telecommunications was the S&P 500’s worst-of-the-worst sector over the same time period, but Cramer is expecting a turnaround here, at least for Verizon.He said the company holds “huge opportunities” in the wireless space, where it owns 55% of the second-largest carrier in the industry, Verizon Wireless. And with the “reaffirmed rumors” that the company will start selling the Apple iPhone in January 2011, “I think … Verizon should lead the industry in terms of market share gains,” given how much of a game-changer the handset was for AT&T. And that’s not even taking into account smartphones as a whole. Only 17% of the company’s wireless subscribers own true smartphones, leaving open a huge opportunity for revenue growth as they make the switch.Click here for more on Verizon.Cramer thinks this graphics chipmaker, down 40% in the first half of the year, should snap back thanks to a number of new revenue-driving products for gaming PCs, notebooks, netbooks tablets and smartphones. There’s also new visual computing software, like Adobe’s Creative Suite 5, require NVIDIA’s high-end semiconductors, also giving a boost to revenues.The company’s ION chips for notebook computers are in 70 laptop designs, 50 of which are scheduled to start production in the next six months. And NVIDIA’s chip for smartphones and tablets should be in a whole slew of products that are also going into production during the last part of the year.For these reasons, NVDA should be ramping ahead of these products launches, not losing nearly half its share-price value. And that’s why Cramer thinks the stock could be “one of the biggest gainers in the second half” of 2010.Click here for more on NVIDIA.Oddly, Jabil’s stock took a 15% hit over the first two quarters of the year, even though the company’s June 22 earnings report showed a business that is firing on all cylinders. The problem? Too much exposure to Europe – as much as 31% of Jabil’s production ends up on the Continent – and that has sent investors running. According to the company, though, there has been no slowdown in business there. So that collective freak-out was all for naught. And as Europe comes back, Cramer said, so should JBL. Investors might consider buying the stock now given how cheap it is.Click here for more on Jabil Circuit.The catalyst for this stock’s rebound will most likely be study that Range Resource conducted on its drilling practices that flew in the face of environmentalists everywhere. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a process by which natural-gas drillers like RRC use large amounts of water with some chemical additives to boost production, and there had been concerns from both environmentalists and the Environmental Protection Agency that it could contaminate drinking water – even though there never been any documented cases of that contamination.Well, Range Resources in July disclosed that , for its Marcellus shale wells, 99.86% of its drilling fluid consists of water and sand, with just 0.14% comprising highly diluted chemicals. RRC was the first company to “open its books,” so to speak, in this way, and RRC rallied accordingly.“I think maybe this the beginning of a major turn in the stock,” Cramer said.Click here for more on Range Resources.This health-care company lost 11.4% of its value this year, in part, because of its exposure to Europe – 24% of the company's sales come from the Continent. But Cramer thinks this will become less of an issue in the second half of the year, as CEO Miles White has vowed to take a conservative stance on European business.Cramer also likes the pharmaceutical company's range of drugs and little exposure to generics. Its flagship product, Humira, is a psoriasis drug and anti-inflammatory, which makes up 35% of the company's sales and is growing by 20%.The Abbott Park, Ill.-based company is also making ""savvy"" acquisitions in emerging markets, including India, which is an $8 billion pharmaceutical market that's expected to double in size by 2015. Plus, the company boasts a 3.6% dividend yield and, for the last 38 years, has increased its payout every year. 2010 should be no different, Cramer said, because it's growing earnings at 11% annually, which is twice the pace of other pharmaceuticals.Click here for more on Abbott Labs.This West Chester, Ohio-based steel company struggled in the first half of the year, posting a 37% decline year-to-date. Cramer didn't like this stock at first because it's not a vertically-integrated steel maker, meaning it doesn't have its own mines and needs to buy its primary raw materials. In other words, AK Steel's operating costs were very high.But Cramer thinks this stock could be poised for a turnaround, as those costs have since plummeted. He also likes the company's management, who reduced the employee headcount by 30% while maintaining the same production capacity. At the same time, the company has used more than $2 billion of internally generated cash to shore up its balance sheet. It has also managed to muddle through the recession without selling equity, issuing debt or cutting its small dividend, which has a 1.4% yield.Click here for more on AK Steel."
2010-08-04,Halftime: Get Into Goldman Ahead Of Spin-Off?,0.2760201061958876,"According to CNBC’s Kate Kelly, Goldman Sachscould spin off at least part of its proprietary trading operations as early as this month.The move comes in the wake of new rules that limit Wall Street firms from betting their own money in financial markets.Though details are still sketchy, a couple of options are on the table. One is to seed a hedge fund staffed by former Goldman proprietary traders with Goldman money and replace it in the coming years with third party money as the new rule goes into effect. Another possibility is to move proprietary trading into the firm's asset management unit, where Goldman invests clients' money rather than its own.How should you trade Goldman in the wake of this news?Instant Insights with the Fast Money tradersI think this is a reason to buy, says Jon Najarian. I like the idea of a spin-off. The move allows Goldman to retain intellectual capital and not have restrictions on the work it does best, muses Joe Terranova. I’m bullish.Also, keep in mind the performance of the capital markets in July was very strong and that should bode well for Goldman’s earnings in October. On top of that, from a technical perspective, I think the stock is poised to break out. Right now is a good spot to get in. I’m not sure I’d start nibbling at Goldman in the high 150’s, says Zach Karabell, but I think the stock is fine.Goldman has already had an amazing run, reminds Brian Kelly. I don’t know if the spin-off is a reason to buy. However, if you like the bank space, then a long position in Goldman makes sense.

But perhaps the greatest concern for investors is that India, which constitutes one of the largest emerging markets and has 1 million BlackBerry users, is threatening to stop BlackBerry services as well.What’s the trade?I don’t care what Saudi Arabia does with BlackBerry and I wouldn’t hold my breath waiting for India to ban BlackBerry, says Zach Karabell. I expect RIM as well as Apple , and the new Android to dominate this space going forward.I got out of my position in RIM, reveals Joe Terranova. I think there are better places to put money. -----------THE RETAIL PLAYRetailers topped the tape on Wednesday ahead of July comp sales due out on Thursday. How should you play the space?I’d play it with bargain names such as TJX, says Brian Kelly.-----------OIL MARCHES HIGHERThe traders were closely watching the action in oil after official figures showed a higher than expected fall in crude stocks.What’s the trade?I’d play the refiners from the long side, counsels Joe Terranova. The higher oil goes the better the chance that the driller moratorium is cut short, adds Brian Kelly. I’d be long the OIH .If you agree with Brian, check out Diamond Offshore, adds Terranova.-----------WHEAT RALLYIn the chart of the day the traders look at wheat, which rallied to fresh 22-month high on concerns about a prolonged drought in Russia. What’s the trade?I think the trade is long Agrium , Mosaic  and Potash , says Joe Terranova.-----------BP PROGRESS REPORTBP reported big progress Wednesday in its attempts to permanently cap the well in the Gulf. They say mud pumped into the well to stop the flow of oil, now appears to be successfully controlling its pressure. Despite the relative success, BP shares moved lower. What’s the trade?I wouldn’t be long BP, says Joe Terranova. If you want to play the space I’d look at Occidental  or Suncor .-----------MEDIA EARNINGSMedia earnings are moving center stage with News Corp releasing results after the bell Wednesday and Viacom  doing the same on Thursday.What should you expect?We’re seeing a broad based recovery, says David Bank of RBC. Just an incredibly buoyant network advertising market at a time when other positive factors are baked in. Largely these stocks are cheap.I’d play the space with OmniCom  and/or Interpublic , says Jon Najarian, as beneficiaries of ad spend ahead of the mid-term elections.Or look at Belo or Media General  as plays on races on Texas and Georgia, adds Brian Kelly.My play is long Disney , says Joe Terranova.Hear more from David Bank including which stock he likes best ahead of earnings. Watch the video now!-----------UNUSUAL ACTION: FIRST SOLAR AND PACTIVJon Najarian has two stocks on his radar due to unusual options action. A large volume of calls traded in First Solar  and Pactiv ; that action suggests to Najarian that positive catalysts may boost both companies.-----------BURGER KING DOWNGRADEYou might say that Burger King was dethroned by analysts at RW Baird; they  downgraded the stock to Neutral from Outperform and cut the price target to $19 from $24.What should you make of it?I still like the stock here, says Brian Kelly. I’d get in.If you want to play the space, I’d look at McDonald’s , says Zach Karabell.-----------CALL TO THE FLOOR: ISISThe traders are closely watching developments in the health sector.

2010-08-19,Weekly M&A Volume Hits Highest Level Since 2009,0.0012566844919786096,"Mergers and acquisitions activity kicked into even higher gear this week as Intel’s $7.67 billion all-cash bid for security technology firm McAfee led to biggest week for M&A since mid-December.The the dealbetween Intel  and McAfee  brings the total value of global M&A deals for the week to $84.81 billion, according to Dealogic.The last time M&A dollar volume was as high was the week Exxon Mobil announced it was buying XTO Energy. That week M&A volume reached $88.6 billion, Dealogic said. Global M&A has now reached $1.7 trillion for the year, up 23 percent from the same period last year, Dealogic said. The volume of U.S. targeted deals is at $498.1 billion, up 1 percent from the same period a year ago, according to the firm, which specializes in technology, data, analytics and consulting for investment banks. The dollar totals don't include spinoffs and repurchases. This week's M&A deals include BHP Billiton's  $39 billion hostile bid for Potash , announced earlier this week.BHP is hoping to win over regulators before approaching Potash shareholders, after the board of the Canadian-fertilizer company rejected BHP's bid. The Intel acquisition is the largest technology M&A deal since September 2009 when Xerox bid $8.1 billion for Affiliated Technologies. The other deals this week include New Zealand's Rank Group’s $4.5 billion bid for Pactiv , the maker of Hefty bags, and Dell’s $1.15 billion for data-storage company 3PAR ."
2010-08-24,Stocks Pare Losses After Housing-Induced Slide,0.09379662004662004,"Stocks pared their losses Tuesday as homebuilder, telecom and some consumer stocks recovered after a sharp drop triggered by a dismal report on home sales.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about 90 points, led by Boeing, Caterpillar and GE, after being down nearly 200 earlier.If it holds, this would be the fourth straight decline for the Dow, which has lost 2.3 percent in the past three sessions.The CBOE volatility index, widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, popped above 27.Existing-home sales fell 27.2 percentin July to an annual rate of 3.83 million units, their lowest pace in 15 years. The prior month was revised lower to show a 5.26 million-unit pace.This came a day after Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig said housing prices are likely to stay low for some timeand Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said the U.S. housing market is already in a double-dip recession.David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, went even further, using the ""D"" word in reference to the entire economy — not just the housing sector.""[W]e are finally exiting the denial stage and heading towards acceptance,"" Rosenberg said in a note to clients. ""[T]his is a depression, and not just some garden-variety recession."" He argues that the Obama administration's stimulus measures aren't working and when the U.S. moves away from them, then they ""will likely have much more reason to turn optimistic.""Of course, doom is a two-sided coin: Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said Europe is at risk for a double-dip recession because of all the austerity measures there, in an interview with a radio station in Ireland.The market's decline had initially accelerated after the housing report but soon snapped back as some pockets of gains began to emerge, most notably, in housing stocks. DR Horton, Pulte and Beazer were among the biggest gainers in the sector.Among other notable gainers were Verizon and AT&T, Walmart and Transocean.Medtronic skidded after the medical-device maker reported its earnings rose but sales fell amid softness in the global health-care market.On the M&A front, Dell  may raise its $18-a-share bid for 3Par  to match or exceed Hewlett-Packard's  $24-a-share counter offer, according to reports. Technology, along with financials and industrials, has been leading the market lower in its August slump. Market pros are getting increasingly worried about tech as even sector darling Apple has struggled. Apple shares are down over 1 percent today and have underperformed in the past month.Analyst Dennis Gartman, in his daily Gartman Letter, noted Tuesday that ""since mid-June Apple has not only failed to make new highs, it has made lower highs and now lower lows. Having closed at $246 last evening, more than 10% below its all time high, the chart looks ominous.""The latest news on the Potash front is that Rio Tinto may bid for fertilizer maker, along with a Chinese partner. Potash is talking with other potential suitors in a bid to get a better price than the nearly $39 billion being offered by Australia's BHP Billiton.Genzyme  and Sanofi-Aventis  are continuing discussions about a Sanofi takeover of Genzyme, though they still haven't agreed on a price, according to the Wall Street Journal.Pfizer  shares slipped after the company said its lung cancer treatment Sutent failed to meet its goal for longer overall survival in a late-stage trial.And Borders Group's chief financial officer Mark Bierley resigned to take another job, shortly after the book retailer named a new chief executive officer.This Week:TUESDAY: 2-year Treasury note auction; Earnings from Burger KingWEDNESDAY: MBA mortgage applications, advance report on durable sales, new home sales, weekly oil inventories, 5-year Treasury note auction; Earnings from BHP Billiton, Toll BrothersTHURSDAY: Weekly jobless claims, 7-year Treasury note auction.FRIDAY: GDP, corporate profits, consumer sentiment; Earnings from TiffanyMore From CNBC.com:15 Biggest Box Office Bombs of All TimeAmerica's Deadliest Jobs 2010Summer Reading: The 10 Best Books for Business"

Also Wall Street Journal report suggested the recent stress tests results out of Europe weren’t as rosy as they appeared.However overseas woes may not be entirely to blame for the domestic sell-off; the move could be as much about technicals. A large number of investors believe that the S&P is range bound. Considering last week was the best week in the past two months, as stocks approached the top of the range investors may have just locked in profits.How should you position now?Instant Insights with the Fast Money tradersIn August the trading low was 1039 and the high was 1128, explains Steve Grasso on Friday's Fast Money.I don’t see anything that suggests the market is anything but range bound and until the S&P breaks above 1130, I'd buy the dips and sell the rips.I’d trim some of my long positions, says Guy Adami on Monday's broadcast. Action in the Vix  gives me pause. It closed above 23.5, that's the 200-day moving average. That's what I did on Tuesday; I took profits in names that had a good run such as McDonald's , says Karen Finerman. I don’t agree that the market goes sharply lower, counters Tim Seymour. There's not a lot of data that should drag us down and key stocks are trading well. I'd position on the thesis that the market drifts higher into mid-September.It seems to me that the big issue right now is the euro-banking problem and the flight to quality it triggers, says Anthony Scaramucci. Until we get a little rise in interest rates I don’t think the market acts much better.----------MARKET BUZZKILL:  RESOURCE/INDUSTRIAL STOCKS Resource and industrial stocks led the way lower on Tuesday due to fears that last week’s euphoria may have been overblown.How should you play the dip?Copper continues to trade well, muses Tim Seymour. I think there’s real industrial demand and not a lot of supply. I’d play the space long copper.Hong Kong rallied sharply on Monday, says Steve Cortes and that suggests to me Asia’s market is strong enough to feel bullish about resources. I’m a buyer of Freeport  and BHP on pullbacks. I also like FCX, says Joe Terranova. And I’d also suggest long US Steel if it breaks above $51, it’s 200-day.----------MARKET BUZZKILL: FINANCIALSAs we mentioned above, investors slammed banks across the world due to renewed fears that Europe’s bank crisis might not be contained after all.What’s the trade?Banks are trading as if they need to have another capital raise, says Guy Adami. I think the space is a little dicey but if you want to be in the space I’d look at longBofA  and US Bancorp .----------STREET FIGHT: H-P STRIKES BACK AT HURDHewlett-Packard sued former Chief Executive Mark Hurd and asked a court to block him from joining Oracle saying his hiring by the rival technology firm puts HP's trade secrets ""in peril.""Oracle, the world's third-largest software maker, named Hurd co-president and director on Monday, a month after he resigned from HP over expense account irregularities related to a female contractor.In a civil complaint filed in Superior Court in Santa Clara County on Tuesday, HP said: ""In his new positions, Hurd will be in a situation in which he cannot perform his duties for Oracle without necessarily using and disclosing HP's trade secrets and confidential information to others.""HP said if Hurd is allowed to go to Oracle it would ""give Oracle a strategic advantage as to where to allocate or not allocate resources and exploit.And on a related note, after hours UBS downgraded HP as well as Intel from 'Buy"" to 'Neutral.'What does ISI analyst Heather Bellini have to say about these developments? * Watch the video and find out now.______________________________________________________Got something to to say?

2010-11-12,Fitch Rates $202MM New York Local Government Assistance Corp. Bonds 'AA'; Outlook Stable ,0.06128892712226047,"NEW YORK, Nov 12, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Fitch Ratings assigns an 'AA' rating
to the following New York Local Government Assistance Corporation (LGAC) bonds:

--$202,550,000 series 2010B refunding bonds (subordinate lien).The bonds are being issued for refunding purposes.In addition, Fitch affirms the 'AA' rating on approximately $3.4 billion of
outstanding LGAC senior and subordinate lien bonds, including the underlying
rating on the series 2003A-4V bonds for which liquidity is being substituted and
insurance removed.Fitch does not make a rating distinction between the senior and subordinate
liens due to the strong coverage and impoundment provisions.The Rating Outlook is Stable.RATING RATIONALE:

--The designated source of payment, a portion of the state sales tax, is
broad-based and provides generous coverage of debt service.--Although bond payments require annual legislative appropriation, there are
strong protective provisions for insufficient funding and non-appropriation.Fitch believes that these features effectively eliminate the risk of
non-appropriation.--The state's economy is broad, with substantial wealth and resources, although
the health of the state's economy and finances is closely linked to the cyclical
financial services industry.--Strong financial planning and reporting practices, including quarterly
financial plan updates, allow the state to stay abreast of changing conditions.This credit strength is offset by the state's historical tendency to rely on
nonrecurring measures rather than sustainable budget solutions to address
revenue weakening in downturns.--New York's debt burden is above average but still in the moderate range, and
pensions are well funded.KEY RATING DRIVERS:

--Changes in New York State's general obligation (GO) rating, to which this
rating is linked.--The state's GO rating will be driven by its continued ability to address
budget shortfalls and protect its cash position.---Further driving the state's rating would be any meaningful change to the
shape of the financial services industry, which would have significant
implications for the state's economy and finances.SECURITY:

LGAC's bonds are general obligations of the corporation, payable, subject to
annual state legislative appropriation, from the yield of one cent of the
four-cent state sales and use tax required by statute to be deposited in the
local government assistance tax fund.CREDIT SUMMARY:

The strength of the state's incentive to appropriate for the LGAC bonds results
in a rating equal to that assigned to New York's GO debt despite the
appropriation requirement for payment of debt service. In the event of
non-appropriation, the state would be unable to receive revenues held by the
LGAC tax fund, which receives one cent of the state's sales tax and contributes
more than $2 billion to the state general fund. Security strengths include the
broad sales tax base, the consistently high level of coverage (about 6.3 times
(x) maximum annual debt service based on fiscal 2010 revenues), and the
structural protections in place. Fitch does not make a rating distinction
between the senior and subordinate liens due to the strong impoundment
provisions and coverage.LGAC was created in 1990 as a means of financing $4.7 billion of the state's
accrued general fund deficit, replacing the annual spring borrowing for local
aid payments. The entire $4.7 billion authorization has been issued and
additional debt can only be issued for refunding purposes.New York's 'AA' GO rating is based on the state's substantial wealth and
resources and broad economy, and also recognizes concerns regarding the outsized
role that the financial services industry plays in the state's economy and
revenue system. State net tax-supported debt levels have been relatively stable
as a percentage of personal income and are expected to remain above average but
still in the moderate range. Pensions are well funded.The state's financial position has been strained. Revenue estimates for fiscal
2010, which ended on March 31, were revised downward repeatedly over the course
of the year, primarily reflecting reduced expectations for the personal income
tax. Despite gap-closing measures taken, fiscal 2010 ended with a deficit of
$1.65 billion that was carried over to fiscal 2011. The budget for fiscal 2011
was not finalized until early August, more than four months into the fiscal
year, although the debt service appropriation bill was passed before the start
of the fiscal year. A fiscal 2011 gap of about $9.2 billion including the
carried-over fiscal 2010 deficit ($8.5 billion after factoring in budget
measures taken in December 2009) was addressed through spending control,
particularly in the area of local aid, temporary and permanent revenue actions,
including a suspension of the sales tax exemption for clothing and a cigarette
tax increase to $4.35 per pack, and limited one-time measures. Deficit financing
was not part of the gap-closing plan; however, the budget includes a substantial
amount of federal stimulus funds. New York, which spends a larger than average
amount on Medicaid, garners particular benefit from the increase in the federal
Medicaid matching percentage included in the federal stimulus package.In contrast to prior downturns, recovery is expected to be slow, and the state
is projected to confront significant outyear budget gaps as federal stimulus and
temporary tax increase monies roll off. Earlier this month, the state reduced
its revenue forecast and increased expenditure expectations. The current fiscal
year (which ends on March 31, 2011) is now reported to have a $315 million
shortfall to be addressed. The fiscal 2012 shortfall estimate has increased to
$9 billion from $8.2 billion, with the large gap reflecting the phase-out of
federal stimulus monies. The gap forecast for fiscal 2013 is now $14.6 billion,
with the expiration of both stimulus funds and the temporary personal income tax
rate increase. Fitch believes that downside risk to the forecast remains.With steep revenue declines, the state's cash position has been strained. The
state has taken proactive measures to ensure cash adequacy, and continued focus
on cash management measures will be necessary. The LGAC bonds are protected from
the cash flow issues by the flow of funds.New York's employment decline in the recession was less severe than that of the
nation. Nonfarm employment did not start to fall, year-over-year, until November
2008 and was down 2.7% in 2009 compared to a 4.3% drop for the U.S. In September
2010, jobs in New York were flat to the prior year while national figures were
up 0.2% year-over-year. Unemployment remains below that of the nation in
September 2010, at 8.3%, 86% of the U.S. level. Personal income performance has
been meaningfully weaker than that of the nation, down 3.1% in 2009, almost
double the national loss and the fourth worst of the states. The state's
personal income per capita was the sixth highest among the states in 2009, at
117% of the U.S. average.New York's net tax-supported debt is above average but still in the moderate
range at 5.6% of personal income. Most of New York's debt has been issued by
state public authorities and secured by appropriations; only about 7% is GO.While this results in a diffuse debt structure, there is strong centralization
and oversight in the budget division, and approval by the public authorities
control board is required for many of these bond issues.Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.In addition to the sources of information identified in the report

2011-01-27,Sara Lee Drops on No-Takeover Report (Update),0.035035438417791366,"UPDATE: The Sara Lee story: it is likely about price and inflationTheDeal.com report that a sale of SLE is unlikely dropped the stock about 4 percent. Reports abound that the Board is meeting today to consider selling pieces of the company, such as the meat or coffee division, or breaking it into separate pieces. The likely problem: inability to agree on a price. Why? Because food companies are in a tough environment, an environment that cannot be easily changed just by getting bigger. The big issue for food companies: inflation. Bernstein, in a recent note to clients, noted that cost of goods sold (COGS) inflation will average 6.7 percent for 2011 for the large food companies like SLE, Kraft , Kellogg  and Campbell's . That is up from a 5 percent estimate that was done in October and way above the 3-5 percent sweet spot preferred by many management teams, they say. Knock-on effects: 1) commodity inflation causes food stocks to underperform because margins get hit 2) when food prices go up, private labels gain market share 3) innovation becomes more important: the ability to raise prices often depends on the ability to introduce new products, rather than renovate existing ones. -----Sara Lee was down as much as 4 percent Thursday on a story in TheDeal.com that a sale of the company appears unlikely, citing unnamed sources. The company  has been widely believed to be a takeover target, or that it might separately sell its meat or beverage businesses. A number of players, including Apollo Global Management and KKR, have reportedly expressed interest in a buyout. Recall that CEO Brenda Barnes stepped down in August for health reasons. Though SLE has many well-known brand names (Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm), it's a tough sell: the food business is highly competitive, and as we have seen in other companies, it is tough to get pricing power. Higher commodity costs, as has been widely reported, add to the uncertainty.More:'Fast Money' Traders: What Commodities Are Saying Now_____________________________Bookmark CNBC Data Pages:The Dow 30 — in Real TimeOil, Gold, Natural Gas Prices NowUS Dollar, Minute by Minute__________________________________________________________Want updates whenever a TraderTalk blog is filed?

2011-01-27,Six Years Before US Jobs Will Come Back: Clinton,0.1659090909090909,"It will take six years to bring US employment back from pre-recession levels, President Bill Clinton told CNBC Thursday. “There's a lot of money in America that could be reinvested,” said Clinton, speaking from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, about the US job situation. The former president has organized a jobs forum in June in Chicago. He said there are people and companies all over the world who are willing to invest in America. Clinton had praise for Germany, which has maintained an unemployment rate two points below that of the US, in part because Germany has been successful selling to China and other growth markets.The former president also said that the federal government’s stimulus programs, such as TARP and the bailout of automobile companies, have been successful, because companies were saved and taxpayers got their investment back."
2011-01-28,What's Wrong With Simon Johnson? ,0.051275510204081644,"Simon Johnson, the former chief economist of the IMF who is now a leading financial commentator at Baseline Scenario, is one of the more prominent critics of the view that blame for the financial crisis falls on affordable housing and fair lending policies. The problem is that his critique is extremely misguided. Let's take this recent column Johnson wrote for Project Syndicate. Johnson begins by attempting to summarize the view that, for example, FCIC commissioner Peter Wallison appears to hold. In December, the Republican minority on the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC), weighed in with a preemptive dissenting narrative. According to this group, misguided government policies, aimed at increasing homeownership among relatively poor people, pushed too many into taking out subprime mortgages that they could not afford. But this isn't quite right. What Wallison argues is that GSEs and banks lowered credit standards and accumulated huge mortgage holdings in an effort to comply with misguided government policies. Shortly after making that mistake, Johnson restates what he takes to be Wallison's point in a way that demonstrates that he doesn't really understand it at all. (Emphasis mine.) This narrative has the potential to gain a great deal of support, particularly in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election. But, while the FCIC Republicans write eloquently, do they have any evidence to back up their assertions? Are poor people in the US responsible for causing the most severe global crisis in more than a generation? It is very difficult to see how that last question follows from anything that came before it. The proposition that the financial crisis was brought about by government policies aimed at increasing homeownership among the poor has no logical connection at all to the culpability of the poor for the crisis. This is easy to understand if we think of other types of misguided government regulations. Take, for example, the regulation of fishing. For years, it has been common practice for regulations to set minimum sizes for fish that can be taken. The idea is to allow fish a chance to mature enough to breed at least once, in hopes that this will keep the population robust. For individual fishermen, this usually means just throwing back a fish that is too small. For large commercial fishermen, however, this involves using fishing techniques that allow smaller fish to escape their nets and traps. Now the purpose of this kind regulation is to preserve the fish population. A recent study, however, indicates that this kind of selective fishing might have the perverse effect of reducing the biodiversity of the fish population and making it more fragile and prone to collapse in the face of unexpected changes. In 2010, a team of researchers wrote: “We believe it is time to critically rethink traditional selective fishing approaches that might not protect ecosystems and fisheries as intended, but may in fact make them more vulnerable to large changes in structure and function.”Now according to Johnsons logic, if we say that a regulation intended to protect smaller fish from harvesting causes the ecosystem to become more vulnerable we are also claiming that small fish are responsible for harming the ecosystem. Clearly, that's nonsense. In the same way, it is simply nonsensical to equate blaming affording housing and fair lending policies for the crisis with blaming the poor. Of course the poor are not responsible for the financial crisis. And the small fish aren't responsible for falling biodiversity.

2011-02-07,Update: Meaningful Breakout In Market?,0.13695287422328226,"Despite chatter last week that the market was overbought, again the bulls pushed the S&P 500 even higher on Monday after solid earnings combined with a flurry of merger news boosted investor appetite for equities.Take a look at some of the big deals that went down:Company               Target                        IndustryDanaher Corp.       Beckman Coulter       Medical DevicesEnsco                  Pride International     Offshore DrillingAOL                     Huffington Post         MediaInvestors take the deal activity to mean Corporate America views stock valuations as attractive. In fact the tone of the Street has changed from negative to positive and instead of an impending correction, investors are now chattering about a meaningful breakout with the S&P above the high end of its recent range. Technically, it's considered a sign of strength; a sign that stocks could go much higher.What should you make of it? How should you position now?Instant Insights with the Fast Money tradersJon Najarian is impressed by all the deal-making. “A lot of folks who thought the market was overextended are now saying if smart guys are stepping in a committing billions, it’s a positive sign. I take it as one more reason not to fight this tape.”Although Brian Kelly has been bearish, he says “you just can’t fight this market.” In fact, he’s hearing a lot of investors are throwing in the towel on the short side. “A lot of money is being put to work and there’s probably value in the market if you believe the economy is getting better,” he says.Yes, he's been looking for a correction too, but Guy Adami admits that he wouldn't fight the tape. ""The market doesn't typically give investors this long to sell the highs,"" he says. ""It probably means we go higher.""Tim Seymour thinks the market action may be a positive sign for blue chips. GE , Pfizer , Exxon , Alcoa, Chevron, DuPont, Caterpillar  and Disney are all at or near their 52-week highs. “I think big cap should continue to work if you believe the economy will continue to work,” he says.EXCLUSIVE: Huffington Talks AOL DealSLIDESHOW: A History of AOL AcquisitionsSteve Grasso feels the riots in Egypt were a bullish ‘tell’ because events could have been a much more negative for stocks than they were. “Egypt showed us point blank what the support is in the market. And its 1275.” In other words, despite the negative catalyst stocks didn’t slip lower than 1273 and Grasso thinks that makes investors more confident.Zach Karabell thinks recent strength in the market should be put in context. “The strength comes off a decade that has been a big fat zero. I think we could still have a significant move higher but remain in the context of a very middling period of time.”-------IS THE OIL TRADE OVER? With oil closing lower for the third straight session, how should you trade oil?Dennis Gartman suggests watching the contango in oil which, he says “has been widening everyday for weeks. It’s saying there’s more than enough oil above ground.""He also suggests keeping an eye on geo-political concerns. ""Now that Egypt has moved to page 7 from page 1 it’s no surprise that crude comes down.""So what's next? When asked if he had to choose between $75 and $100 as oil's next stop he replies ""that crude will probably print $75 before it prints $100.""Check out the entire interview.

2011-03-30,Small Radiation Found in Washington State Milk: FDA,-0.056249999999999994,"The Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration say that very low levels of radiation have turned up in a sample of milk from Washington state. But federal officials say consumers should not worry.The FDA said such findings are to be expected in the coming days because of the nuclear crisis in Japan, and that the levels are expected to drop relatively quickly.Results from a March 25 milk sample taken from Spokane, Wash., show levels of radioactive Iodine-131 that are still 5,000 times below levels of concern set by the FDA, including levels set for infants and children.The EPA said it is increasing the level of nationwide monitoring of milk, precipitation and drinking water following the crisis at the Japanese nuclear power plant."
2011-05-19,Energy Falls Despite 'Above Average' Hurricane Forecast,0.06922348484848484,"The federal government’s main weather forecasting agency warns of an “above average” hurricane season this summer.Yet, the energy market yawns.That's because the pre-season hurricane forecasts are too early, too broad and do not indicate where a storm will actually hit, according to traders.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration dialed back its Atlantic hurricane season forecast a little from last year. NOAA is predicting there will be 12 to 18 named storms, and six to 10 hurricanes. Three to six of those will be major hurricanes — Category 3, 4 or 5 — with winds of 111 miles per hour or more. The Atlantic hurricane season typically lasts from June 1 to November 30.NOAA is predicting this season we’ll see one less storm than last year. But so did Colorado State University in their 2011 forecast that was released in the beginning of April. CSU predicted the 2011 Atlantic Hurricane season would see 16 named storms, including five major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher). So NOAA’s forecast wasn’t much different.Energy traders also point out that while there were five major hurricanes — in line with NOAA’s range of forecasts — none of them made landfall near any key U.S. oil or gas facilities. But that’s not the only reason this year’s NOAA forecast hasn’t had any immediate impact on energy prices today.NOAA's pre-season hurricane forecasts are much broader than the closely watched outlook's from Colorado State University and some private forecasters. As a result, these hurricane forecasts have a greater chance of making their mark. Last May, NOAA forecast there would be a 70 percent chance that we'd have between 14 and 23 named storms and  three to seven would be major hurricanes. That's a huge range. It’s hard to miss that. The season ended with a total of 19 named storms and five reached hurricanes of Category 3 or higher.The real impact, of course, comes when a storm or hurricane makes landfall in a major metro area or near a key refinery complex. Last year was the third most active on record and no storm made landfall on the continental U.S. Unlike some private forecasters, NOAA does not issue forecasts on how many storms will make landfall or where they could make landfall in its pre-season outlook.So what more do traders know today about this year’s hurricane season than they did yesterday? Not much.Slideshow: Scenes from the 2011 Floods"
2011-06-19,Countries With the Most Expensive Private Schools,0.039134671732925015,"Despite the rising cost of private schools, demand continues to grow across the world. For many, private schooling buys luxury, exclusivity and privacy. In many developing countries, private education is a must-have for parents who want their children to succeed.Across the world, the cost of private education has risen faster than incomes. In the U.S., private high schools cost over $40,000, compared to a median income of around $50,000.  In the U.K., boarding school fees jumped 65 percent from 1992 to 2008, while household incomes increased only 30 percent over the same period, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.We’ve put together a list of the countries with the most expensive private schools based on the cost of sending a child to one of the top three or four private schools in that country.We used annual tuition fees for high school students for both day and boarding schools. Since boarding is often the more expensive option, we ranked the countries by boarding fees, except in the cases of China and Brazil.The fees we considered include boarding, food and basic curriculum costs, but exclude charges such as registration fees, deposits, extra-curricular activities and field trips. We also excluded schools that specialized in children with special needs.Click ahead to find out which countries have the world’s most expensive private schools.By  Posted: June 19, 2011Most Expensive:  Hilton CollegeAnnual Tuition: $25,614Students in Private School: 2.5%South Africa has a long tradition of all-boys boarding schools that were established in the 1800s by Dutch and British missionaries.

2011-07-01,Will the US Debt Ceiling be Raised by Aug 2?,-0.12249999999999998,"Republicans and Democrats have until August 2nd to reach a deal on raising the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling. The Senate canceled its planned July 4 recess and lawmakers are racing against the clock to avert a debt default. Lawmakers have been unable to reach a consensus, with Republicans and Democrats sharply divided over spending cuts and tax hikes. Republicans want Democrats to agree to $2 trillion in spending cuts and not to hike taxes. They've walked out on talks led by Vice President Joe Biden. Meanwhile Democrats are looking at a scaled-back deal, which would raise the debt ceiling and buy enough time until after the 2012 Presidential election. Some analysts are worried that the game of brinkmanship between the two sides could lead to a default, even if it is for a few hours. Ratings agencies have warned that such a 'technical default' would hurt the U.S.'s Triple-A rating.Time is running out and we want to know whether you think there's enough political will for a deal to be done in time."

Among key S&P stocks, energy and financials slipped, while consumer staples gained. “There’s going to be continued volatility in the markets throughout the summer months into early fall,” said Zahid Siddique, portfolio manager of Gabelli Equity Trust. “[But] as the economic indicators begin to improve, there will be less volatility and more stability in the markets by year-end.” Meanwhile, the ISM non-manufacturing index slipped slightly below estimates to 53.3 in June. Economists expected the index to fall to 54.0.“The market really wanted some glimmer of hope that we’re exiting a soft patch…and this is not it,” Jim Iuorio, director of TJM Institutional Services told CNBC. “There’s too much to bear for the stock market to go higher.”Meanwhile, the number of planned layoffs increasedfor the second month in a row, according a report from job outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. This comes ahead of a number of key employment news starting with ADP's jobs survey and weekly jobless claims on Thursday and the government's monthly report on Friday.

2011-07-20,Germany Should Have Ratings Cut to Save Euro: Strategist,0.0655830280830281,"Germany, the euro zone's largest economy, should be prepared to take a downgrade to its AAA-rated debt to help save the single currency area, Charles Diebel, head of market strategy at Lloyds, told CNBC Wednesday. ""You have joined this club, and you had to realise there was a liability that went with it,"" he said. ""Germany should really be doing a cost-benefit analysis of what it costs them not to help.""A break-up of the euro zone would be a ""cataclysmic scenario"" while a downgrade of Germany's AAA-related debt one notch would only mean a 30-50 basis points cut to its credit swaps, according to the Lloyds  strategist. ""That's a lot better than your entire banking system getting into trouble from a break- up of the euro,"" he said. ""If you look at where European swaps are trading, that's effectively a proxy for the Bund anyway."" EU leaders will meet Thursday to discuss the Greek debt crisis, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy meeting on Wednesday. Merkel has warned that there is ""not one spectacular result that will solve all problems"". John M. Hydeskov, chief analyst at Danske Markets, said Nordic banks came particularly strongly out of the recent stress tests as Danske ran a harsher stress test over the Nordic banks which were put through the EBA stress tests. ""Markets have been impatient for quite a long time,"" Hydeskov told CNBC Wednesday. Some of the smaller, steadier European economies, such as Holland, Finland and Austria, are worth investing in, according to Diebel. The current Italian and Spanish yields ""are not justified by the fundamental factors"", Hydeskov said. ""If you look at the private sector wealth in Italy it's pretty impressive,"" he said. The strength of domestic investment in Italy, where around half of government bonds are held by the domestic market, is viewed by many as strength relative to Greece and other peripheral euro zone economies. ""You can control the domestic market to some extent,"" Hydeskov added. He said that domestic Italian investors were unlikely to suddenly switch from bonds, as ""now is not the time to switch investment strategy""."
2011-08-02,Revolving Door at SEC Is Hurdle to Crisis Cleanup,0.07247862220084442,"A senior lawyer for the Securities and Exchange Commission recently took center stage in a major case involving a controversial mortgage security sold by Goldman Sachs.There was just one slight twist in the legal proceedings. The S.E.C. lawyer was not the prosecutor taking the deposition. He was the witness.This summer, Adam Glass — who joined the agency two years ago and is now co-chief counsel in charge of helping write the rules for the complex financial instruments known as derivatives — testified in a deposition about Goldman’s Abacus, a mortgage investment that the government argues was designed to fail.It turns out that Mr. Glass has a unique perspective on Wall Street exotica. Before working on the financial crisis cleanup, he helped create the opaque securities that contributed to the mess.For many years, Mr. Glass served as the outside counsel to Paulson & Company, the giant New York hedge fund firm run by John Paulson, who made billions betting against the housing market. And yes, Mr. Glass, in that role, signed off on Abacus, which was created specifically for the hedge fund to short subprime mortgages. Mr. Paulson handpicked some of the underlying investments in the derivative.The government, in its complaint, claimed that Goldman had “misstated and omitted key facts regarding” Abacus, including disclosing Mr. Paulson’s role in its creation. The firm paid $550 million to settle the case, without admitting or denying guilt. Mr. Paulson was never accused of any wrongdoing.Mr. Glass’s recent deposition was for a separate S.E.C. case against Fabrice Tourre, the young Goldman trader who had developed and marketed Abacus to investors. Mr. Tourre, 31, has denied the accusations.The revelation of Mr. Glass’s involvement in the Abacus deal could undermine the S.E.C.’s case — or at least prove to be a distracting embarrassment.Perhaps more important, his role once again raises questions about the revolving door between Washington and Wall Street at a time when public distrust about the agency and its lack of enforcement action against the culprits of the crisis is running high.“There are a lot of talented people out there you could hire who weren’t necessarily part of the problem,” said Mary Kreiner Ramirez, a professor at Washburn University School of Law. “If he was involved in Abacus, how is he supposed to police it?”It is a common question as the government increasingly looks to fill its ranks with regulatory officials proficient in the language of Wall Street. Robert S. Khuzami, the S.E.C.’s director of enforcement, was previously the general counsel of Deutsche Bank. The agency tapped Eileen Rominger, the former global chief investment officer at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, as its director of investment management.“The revolving door is such a dominant fact about the S.E.C.’s culture,” said John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia Law School professor. “You get people who go to Washington for one to three years and then go back to Wall Street.”The pattern has been well documented. According to the Project on Government Oversight, 219 former S.E.C. staff members filed 789 “postemployment statements indicating their intent to represent an outside client before the commission” from 2006 to 2010. In other words, the one-time government officials are representing Wall Street clients with matters before the agency.While clearly there are questions about whether the public wants someone in government who just came from industry, the opposite argument can be made, too: It may be better to have the fox in the henhouse.President Franklin D. Roosevelt “justified appointing Joe Kennedy as chairman of the S.E.C. with the line: ‘You need to set a thief to catch a thief,’ ” said Professor Coffee. “That is the case for bringing in an industry expert.”After all, the best way for the government to stay ahead of financial innovations — or at least not fall too far behind — is to employ people who know them best.After the government’s bailout of A.I.G. , some said the insurer should keep paying bonuses to employees, as they were among the few who understood how to unwind some of the company’s complex trades.Mr. Glass, who has long advocated more regulation of derivatives in certain instances, came to the S.E.C. with a strong finance pedigree. A graduate of Harvard and of Stanford Law School, Mr. Glass was a partner at Linklaters, where he founded the firm’s structured finance and derivatives practice.In addition to Paulson & Company, he counted Deutsche Bank and Lehman Brothers among his top clients. Mr. Glass was not involved in the controversial opinion that Linklaters issued to Lehman about a practice known as Repo 105 that has come under scrutiny. The tactic allowed Lehman to conceal billions of dollars on its balance sheet.Mr. Glass took a big pay cut to become a civil servant. The average Linklaters partner made about $2.3 million in 2008, the year before he left, according to Legal Week, an industry publication. The most Mr. Glass could make at the S.E.C. is $233,000.When I asked Mr. Glass about his deposition in the Tourre case and his role as the lawyer for Mr. Paulson in the Abacus transaction, he said, “Yes, that would be true.” He then directed me to the S.E.C.’s spokesman, who quickly issued a “no comment.” Spokesmen for Mr. Tourre and Mr. Paulson also declined to comment.Mr. Glass was involved in reviewing the Abacus deal. He reviewed and commented on an “engagement letter” between Goldman and ACA, the firm that insured the deal, said three people with knowledge of his testimony and e-mails. He also received a draft copy of the “offering circular” and term sheet provided to outside investors, but those documents did not include disclosures about how Mr. Paulson’s firm had selected certain mortgage-backed securities for the investment vehicle that he was betting against. The offering circular stated that ACA would select the initial portfolio.The potential obfuscation of Mr. Paulson’s role is at the center of the case against Mr. Tourre. Mr. Glass, who testified that he did not recall seeing the offering document, did not ask for additional disclosure about Mr. Paulson’s role or comment on the disclosure language, said the people briefed on his deposition. But Mr. Glass had no legal duty to Goldman’s clients.Mr. Glass worked with Mr. Paulson’s firm to help structure similar mortgage deals, and in one instance he pushed for additional disclosures. On a Deutsche Bank derivatives deal, Mr. Glass suggested that the bank might want to include more explicit disclosure language for its clients, according to a person briefed on the deal. Deutsche Bank did not take Mr. Glass’s advice.In the end, Mr. Glass is tangential to the S.E.C.’s case against Mr. Tourre. But he is a central example in the age-old debate about the benefits and costs of Washington’s revolving door.“I don’t think Mr. Glass has done anything unethical in helping Mr. Paulson structure this product,” Professor Coffee said.“But it is a case that will raise further questions about the S.E.C.”"
2011-08-16,World’s Most Popular Business Cities,0.10076503412812937,"A shift in economic growth from the West to emerging markets over the past decade has led to the emergence of new business hubs across the world.Regions such as Asia, the Middle East and South America have seen rapid economic growth, coupled with improved infrastructure, and in some cases, lighter regulation. Multinational organizations have rushed to capitalize on this, increasing the number of people they hire in these countries and setting up new offices in emerging markets. For example, banks including HSBC and Barclays have said they will increase hiring in Asia, while cutting staff in developed markets. GE, for example, has moved the headquarters of its X-ray business to Beijing from the U.S.The emergence of these new business centers has sometimes come at the expense of the traditional centers such as New York, Frankfurt and London. But it hasn't always been smooth. Dubai, which experienced huge investments in real estate over the past decade, faced a property bust in 2009.We decided to look at the top business hubs in the world based on research by global real estate firm CB Richard Ellis, which surveyed 300 of the world's largest companies, including Fortune 500 firms and other non-listed entities, such as law firms. The ranking is based on what percentage of these companies have offices in these cities.We've matched that with the cost of renting office space in the central business districts (CBDs) of these hubs from real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. Office rent cost is measured in square meter per year.The results might surprise you with some of the largest North American cities absent. So which cities are the world's most popular business hubs? Click ahead to find out.By: Rajeshni Naidu-Ghelani(Posted: August 16, 2011)Companies Present: 55.7 percentOffice Rental Cost: $1,093 per sq. meterParis, one of the world's major cultural centers, is one of only three Western European cities to make the list of the world's top 10 business centers. France comes in third among European countries with the most international companies present.Paris, like its other Western counterparts, plays host to offices of many front-office business functions because of its advanced economy and high skills base. Professional services and the insurance sector have a large representation in Paris, while automobile and mining firms are the least represented. The city is home to French banking giant BNP Paribas and insurer AXA. In fact, the Paris region accounts for almost 30 percent of France's economy.Rents for office space rose 9 percent in 2010, despite ongoing economic debt worries in France and the wider Euro region. That's because a lack of new supply pushed commercial rents higher.Companies Present: 56.1 percentOffice Rental Cost: $524 per sq. meterDubai is the top business hub in the Middle East and African region, reflecting the success of its government's strategy to promote it as a regional center. The city has also benefited as a ""safe haven"" for foreign companies amid political unrest in the Arab world.Dubai attracted more than 70 percent of the firms polled by CB Richard Ellis in the industrial goods and services sectors. Given its strategic location—halfway between Europe and Asia—it often serves as the head office for higher-level decision-making.Incentives such as tax breaks and a more liberal attitude toward Western culture, such as women not having to cover their heads in public, have made Dubai a popular city for expatriate staff. The Dubai International Financial Centre, the firm running the emirate's tax-free business park, said 64 companies joined its free zone in the first half of 2011—an 8 percent increase from last year.But, there are some government restrictions that make it difficult for international companies to operate in the local market. For example, businesses must be 51 percent owned by a citizen of the United Arab Emirates.Dubai's property market has still not fully recovered from the Gulf state's property bust and debt crisis in 2009. In 2010, the Middle East and Africa were the only regions in the world that saw a continuing decline in office rental costs. Dubai saw rents go down by as much as 20 percent, as significant oversupply and high vacancy rates plagued the domestic market.Companies Present: 59.6 percentOffice Rental Cost: $484 per sq. meterMadrid is home to more than 75 percent of companies in the media, technology and telecommunications sector, about the same level as New York, giving Madrid equal bragging rights as a media capital. The city is also home to Telefonica—Europe's second-largest phone company.Madrid is the third largest city in the European Union (EU) after London and Paris, and accounted for more than 12 percent of Spain's gross domestic product in 2009. The city has held up better than the rest of the country, which has been facing a property bust and debt crisis. Its unemployment rate was 4.5 percentage points lower than the national average of 21.3 percent in the first quarter of 2011. Office rental prices have suffered though, dropping 7 percent in 2010 due to low demand.As the capital of the country, Madrid also benefits from Spain's popularity among foreign companies. In fact, Spain is among the top five countries in the world when it comes to attracting international companies. In all, Europe accounts for five of the top 10 nations in terms of hosting offices of the biggest international firms. A big draw for these companies is the size of the European consumer market and the ease with which companies in the EU can expand into neighboring countries.Companies Present: 60.4 percentOffice Rental Cost: $735 per sq. meterBeijing is one of the world's most heavily populated cities, with nearly 20 million residents. It's among five Asian cities that make the Top 10 list.The city has a high concentration of mining, construction, and agricultural companies. Firms that have a high level of interaction with government agencies and state-owned companies, as well as those in highly regulated sectors such as energy and mining, tend to set up an office in China's political center.Companies trying to access the growing local consumer markets also have a big presence in the city. Beijing's automobile sector has boomed in recent years, as China has become the world's largest car market by volume sales. German automaker Daimler opened a Mercedes-Benz design center in the city last month, while U.S. carmaker General Motors runs ventures with state auto groups SAIC Motor and FAW Group.Beijing has been rapidly developing prime office space following a government push to develop the central business district. Office rents went up by a whopping 48 percent in 2010 because of increased domestic demand for high-quality office space and limited supply.Companies Present: 60.7 percentOffice Rental Cost: $850 per sq. meterMoscow's ranking as the sixth most popular business hub, and the second most popular in Europe, shows Russia's importance as an emerging market.International firms find it difficult to do business in Russia without a domestic office, given high levels of bureaucracy and corruption, which is one reason why the city is so important for foreign companies. The fact the Moscow has better infrastructure and much higher levels of development than other large cities is another reason.The city of 13 million has a high concentration of companies in the professional services sector given its highly skilled labor force and the fact that it often acts as a hub for operations in Central and Eastern Europe.A redevelopment of Moscow's city center and the construction of the Moscow International Business Center have also helped cement the city's reputation as a hub.Companies Present: 61.4 percentOffice Rental Cost: $812 per sq. meterShanghai is home to China's major financial institutions and mainland stock exchange, receiving significant capital inflows from Hong Kong.Its position on the Yangtze River Delta also gives companies easy access to China's large manufacturing base, research and development, and back office operations in the region. These factors have resulted in a concentration of mining, construction, and commodity companies being based in the city. Many firms are starting to move west, however, to access cheaper labor.Government initiatives to reduce economic disparity between cities has led to better infrastructure in other regions, with the plan that Shanghai and Beijing will likely become service-based cities and the inland markets will manage the manufacturing and distribution functions.Shanghai has also becoming a key regional center in Asia. U.S. technology and manufacturing firm Honeywell moved its Singapore-based Asia-Pacific headquarters to the city in 2003, while German chip giant Infineon relocated its Hong Kong-based regional head office to Shanghai. As a result of growing demand, the city saw annual office rents rise by as much as 28 percent in 2010.Companies Present: 63.2 percentOffice Rental Cost: $1,683 per sq. meter (West End) or $974 per sq. meter (City)London has a long history as one of the world's top business centers, but in recent years a number of emerging markets have challenged its global ranking.The city still attracts the highest number of international companies in Europe and dominates in the banking, financial, and professional services sectors worldwide. London has more than 480 overseas banks and is home to multinational heavyweights such as Rio Tinto. The city has the most international visitors in the world and accounts for over 20 percent of the U.K.'s economy.Prime rents rebounded in London in 2010 after the global financial crisis. The city's West End saw annual rental growth top 27 percent due to limited supply of new construction. In comparison, rents in Ireland, Spain, and Greece fell by 19 percent, 7 percent, and 3 percent, respectively, in the same period.Companies Present: 63.9 percentOffice Rental Cost: $20,469 per sq. meterTokyo is home to 47 Japanese Fortune 500 companies, including Honda, Sony, and Mitsubishi. The city is also headquarters to several of the world's largest investment banks and insurance companies. It is also known as one of the three command centers of the world economy, along with New York and London. Often at the top of the world's most expensive cities list, Tokyo has faced several setbacks in recent years with stagnant economic growth and natural disasters crippling the Japanese economy.Tokyo slipped two places in 2010 to number three from being the most expensive office location in the world in 2009. Rents fell by more than 11 percent from the previous year as the city became a ""tenants market"" with vacancy rates rising and rental levels decreasing.Companies Present: 67.5 percentOffice Rental Cost: $850 per sq. meterSingapore is the highest ranked Asian city on the list. It has become a gateway for businesses and investors trying to access to world's fastest growing consumer markets in China.Being in the same time zone as key Asian markets, such as mainland China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Indonesia, has been a major factor. The city is also home to two Fortune 500 companies—contract electronics manufacturer Flextronics and commodities trader Wilmar International.The island nation's high-quality infrastructure, efficient administration, low taxes, as well as its busy shipping port and airport, have made it a top choice for many international companies and their expatriate employees.The city is also home to many companies in the banking and financial services sector, and comes in fourth behind London, New York, and Hong Kong in terms of the number of financial services firms with offices there.Office rents went up as much as 16 percent in 2010, with further increases expected this year as corporations expand and demand continues to rise.Companies Present: 68.2 percentOffice Rental Cost: $2,297 per sq. meterHong Kong is the world's most popular city for international businesses, reflecting a shift in economic power to Asia in recent years.Hong Kong holds a unique position because of its location and lack of foreign ownership restrictions, which allow companies to operate globally and still have access to a highly skilled and low-cost workforce. Cities such as Hong Kong and Singapore are seen as key business hubs, with access to the anticipated growth in surrounding emerging markets. Leading financial multinationals headquartered in Hong Kong include Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and Credit Suisse.Annual rents for office space jumped 51 percent in 2010 from the year before, and high demand and limited supply is expected to push up rents by a further 15 to 20 percent this year."

While stocks initially sold off, they have now made a modest comeback. For the first time in a while, there's no real gaming of the Fed, and many traders think that is a good thing. ""True equity bulls don't want people buying because of (quantitative easing)  in there with them... they want other true bulls and strong hands,"" one trader wrote to me. Bernanke did not make any new policy pronouncements, as expected. He did say that the meeting in September would be two days instead of one; that may give room for discussion of a larger range of policy responses. Bernanke reiterated that the Fed had ""a range of tools that could be used to provide additional monetary stimulus."" He kicked the ball into the court of President Obama and the Congress: ""Most of the economic policies that support robust economic growth in the long run are outside the province of the central bank..."" In other words, he's telling the executive and legislative branches to do their job.European Central Bank President Trichet is also speaking in Jackson Hole Saturday, and Bernanke lobbed a little grenade in his direction as well: """"I have confidence that our European colleagues fully appreciate what is at stake in the difficult issues they are now confronting, and that, over time, they will take all necessary and appropriate steps to address those issues effectively and comprehensively.""Some are expecting Trichet to signal a more dovish position on rates. _____________________________Bookmark CNBC Data Pages:The Dow 30 — in Real TimeOil, Gold, Natural Gas Prices NowUS Dollar, Minute by Minute_____________________________Want updates whenever a Trader Talk blog is filed?

Donald Carty, chairman of Virgin America and former AMR chairman and CEO, noted ""there's very little expectation about [Thursday's] speech or anything that will happen in the next eighteen months.""Lack of confidence is a result of the government's inability ""to delvelop a plan to fix these problems,"" he added. ""Demand is not going to come back in the U.S. because everybody is holding back because of this concern.""""The uncertainty lies in the fact that we know there are fundamental problems in this economy—they're severe, they're significant,"" Cart went on to say.

He's [Obama] trying to do what he can to work with the business community,"" added Parsons.Joe Echevarria, Deloitte's new U.S. CEO stressed that growth comes from offering incentives to the private sector ""through tax reform, regulation and responsible fiscal policy.""But it needs to be done in a ""pragmatic"" way with a responsible government and less politics,"" he said.  Heather Bresch, CEO of Mylan Labs, said unemployment is ""tough to band-aid when it’s of such epic proportions.""""There needs to be a real recognition of what is job creation and that there’s a difference between a government job and a private sector job...We really need to step back and live within our means,"" added Bresch.

Without demand we can have all the certainty in the world and all the clarity about regulation, but to me it’s not so much about confidence as it is about demand,"" explained Faraci.Indra Nooyi, chairman and CEO of PepsiCo, noted that ""anything that's done to address unemployment in terms of massive stimulus spending is going to exacerbate deficits. And anything that's done to address deficits in the short-term is going to exacerbate unemployment.""Nooya went on to say we're in ""a bit of a policy box and it's going to require us being willing to give up one of the two, which is it's okay to take on more deficits but lets put in some massive spending. Alternatively to say, 'we're going to go through structural unemployment for a while because we want to address deficits.'""At this point I think we are all trying to address this conundrum by saying we have to address both sides, unfortunately there is no way out of this,"" Nooya added.Michael George, CEO of QVC, noted the importance of ""making sure that there's a tax code and an investment code that supports the formation and growth of small businesses."" ""We need a cohesive plan to grow jobs, and to restore some confidence that the government can work and make decisions"" in order to move forward, George went on to say."

2011-09-19,Goldman's Best Energy Stocks for the Next Six Months ,0.08361633249791146,"Goldman Sachs, which advised investors to sell oil in April and reversed its stance before prices rebounded a month later, is now the most bullish on four stocks in the industry. The global investment bank is highest on Noble Energy , whose shares may rise 50 percent in the next six months, according to its forecast. Goldman Sachs says Brent crude oil should rise to about $130 a barrel within a year from $114 today, driven by demand in emerging economies. A slowdown in economic growth has had analysts scrambling to alter their forecasts. Even the Federal Reserve has said the U.S. economy is growing more slowly than it had expected earlier in the year. The International Energy Agency last week reduced its oil demand estimate by 0.2 million barrels a day for 2011 and 0.4 million barrels a day for 2012. However, the agency still forecasts oil demand to be marginally higher than the current supply next year.Analysts are bullish on select stocks as industry consolidation is ongoing, and because high growth rates in emerging markets provide a floor for share prices and oil stocks can serve as an inflation hedge. Some companies are paying outsized dividends, which are attractive as Treasury yields have fallen to less than 2 percent. For example, Exxon Mobil carries a hefty 2.6 percent projected dividend yield, in addition to an estimated 35 percent stock-appreciation forecast over the next six months. Oil and gas exploration and production companies' shares are down an average of 13 percent this year, according to Morningstar. That's three times as much as that of the benchmark S&P 500 Index. So anyone moving into oil stocks now must reconcile the fact that the industry has been a laggard. Here are Goldman Sachs' current ""conviction list"" energy-stock picks: 1. Noble Energy is a Houston-based oil and gas producer in the U.S., with diverse developable resources including in Equatorial Guinea, the North Sea, Israel and China. It has extensive offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico. About 30 percent of its natural gas production is in the U.S., including oil shale projects. Goldman analysts said in a recent research note that Noble ""has a strong balance sheet, with a 16 percent net debt to tangible capital ratio even before substantial expected free cash flow in the next three years, as long lead time projects come online."" Noble gets a six-month $121 price target from Goldman, which is a 50 percent premium to its current price. Its shares have a projected 1 percent dividend yield. The company's shares are down 5 percent this year, but up 6 percent over the past 12 months, giving it a market valuation of $14 billion. 2. Exxon Mobil, one of the world's largest companies, is an integrated oil and gas producer and distributor and also the world's biggest refiner. It is also one of the world's top manufacturers of commodity and specialty chemicals. Due to its operational efficiencies, it consistently delivers higher returns on capital relative to peers and its sheer size gives it leverage in the competition for developable oil projects worldwide. Its current production mix is evenly split between liquids and natural gas. In its latest blockbuster deal, the company announced Sept. 2 that it had entered an agreement with the Russian-government owned oil company Rosneft, to jointly explore and develop oil and gas resources in Russia, the U.S., and other countries. Its strong, steady cash flow assures increasing dividend payments and stock buy backs, even while funding huge capital-intensive projects. Goldman has a six-month $97 price target on its shares, a 33 percent premium to its current price. Its shares are up 1 percent this year and 22 percent over the past 12 months, giving it a $356 billion market valuation. 3. CVR Energy is a nitrogen-fertilizer and petroleum-refining company. It also runs a crude-oil gathering system and storage facility in Kansas and a proprietary pipeline system that transports crude oil to its refinery. Goldman has a six-month $32 price target on its shares, a 23 percent premium to the current price. Its shares are up 65 percent this year and 207 percent over the past 12 months, giving it a $2.2 billion market value. 4. Hornbeck Offshore: The only repeat on the conviction list of three months ago is Hornbeck Offshore, a provider of offshore supply vessel fleets, which it uses to transport goods and supplies to and from offshore rigs and platforms, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. It also has a large fleet of tug and tank barges, which mostly transport petroleum. Goldman analysts say the company remains on their list based on the belief ""that the recovery in the Gulf of Mexico is under way."" They write that ""earnings should accelerate sharply over the next few quarters as additional (offshore vessels) go to work. We expect Hornbeck to return to profitability as soon as the fourth quarter."" It posted a loss of 26 cents per share in the second quarter. The firm has a $31 price target on its shares over the next six months, a 12 percent premium to its current price. Its shares have a market value of $751 million. They've been rocketing, gaining 14 percent in the past month, 36 percent this year and 79 percent over the past 12 months. ______________________________CNBC Data Pages:Dow 30 Stocks—In Real Time Oil, Gold, Natural Gas Prices Now Where's the US Dollar Today?Track Treasury Prices Here______________________________ Disclosures:TheStreet's editorial policy prohibits staff editors, reporters and analysts from holding positions in any individual stocks.Disclaimer"

2011-10-07,One-on-One with Jack Welch,0.1278333223180551,"Yesterday I spoke to the legendary Jack Welch, former Chairman and CEO of GE. In addition to his comments on a variety of issues, I began asking Mr. Welch about the very sad passing of Steve Jobs.LARRY KUDLOW, host: We welcome back to THE KUDLOW REPORT an old friend, the great famed CEO Jack Welch. Mr. Welch, thank you for coming back, sir. Mr. JACK WELCH: Larry, it's great to be here. KUDLOW: Let me just begin, as we have all day, luminaries like yourself, the way too soon passing of the brilliantentrepreneur Steve Jobs, what's your thought on that? Mr. WELCH: Absolutely tragic. I mean, his family has certainly had the biggest loss, but America and the world has lost something. He wasn't just a genius entrepreneur, he was an executor. He got—people are not giving him enough credit for getting a million or two million or five million to the customer on time with great quality. That's a real job. KUDLOW: He was a great retailer and a great marketer you got there. Mr. WELCH: Great marketer. Great—a supply chain manager and a great genius of an entrepreneur. He—to show you his impact, though, I had an experience at home. My stepson's grandmother called, 85 years old, upset as could be. KUDLOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. WELCH: The kids called from college, two of them. They don't call when CEOs die. KUDLOW: Yeah. Mr. WELCH: They were so impacted. What this guy did for business, he invented cool. KUDLOW: Yeah. Mr. WELCH: He made cool--most business guys are in suits like you are and I am right now. KUDLOW: Right. Mr. WELCH: This guy, though, delivered products that made business cool. KUDLOW: And he made a better world of it. I think... Mr. WELCH: You know... KUDLOW: ...everybody agrees that his impact was just vastly beyond just being a businessman. Mr. WELCH: Oh. KUDLOW: Just vastly beyond. Mr. WELCH: I mean, he was a true visionary. KUDLOW: Yeah. All right, I appreciate that very much. Let me come back to some of the current events of the day. President Obama had a lengthy news conference today, over an hour. Among the many points he made, I want to get your take on this, he is endorsing the Senate Democrats' idea of a 5.6 percent surtax on millionaires. And the president also indicated, however, that other tax increases would still be necessary to fund the budget. Do we need a millionaires tax? Will it help the economy grow? And the whole tax plan, how do you see it? Mr. WELCH: Will this—will this tax be on income or wealth? KUDLOW: I think it's going to cover capital gains, dividends and ordinary income, as far as I know, take effect in 2013. Mr. WELCH: Well, look, I think we ought to go back and look at what he's done so far, Larry. He put a stimulus bill in, $785 billion, whatever it was. It did nothing. Now, let's look at what he projected. He projected we'd have 6.2 percent unemployment in October 2011. We've got 9! Larry, if you're in a business and you miss by that much, somebody's calling you in for a chat. KUDLOW: And, in fact, his whole plan is doubling down. Now... Mr. WELCH: Same plan. KUDLOW: ...the financing, it's more spending. I don't want to prejudge it, but it's more spending, and it's temporary tax rebates or temporary tax credits. It didn't work for George W. Bush, it didn't work for Barack Obama 1. Why should it work for Obama? 2. Isn't there a better way? We all know the economy is in lousy shape and it's faltering, as Bernanke said. Jack, with your experience, what's the better way to grow this economy? Mr. WELCH: I would say you start out with discretionary spending. It's 1.3, 1.4 billion. Eight hundred and fifty of it's defense, 450 is total discretionary. Take 25 percent of the 450, that's $100 million, 90 or so. Take 5 percent of defense, that's 50... KUDLOW: Take it out of the budget? Mr. WELCH: Take it out of the budget. KUDLOW: Right. Mr. WELCH: Take--but reduce it, not from projections, actual take it out. KUDLOW: Level. The level. Mr. WELCH: The level we're at. KUDLOW: Right. Mr. WELCH: Take it down. That's a billion-three or a billion-five—a trillion-three or a trillion-five over 10 years. That's one step, OK? Step number two, freeze regulations. KUDLOW: Right. Mr. WELCH: Freeze them. This Senator Johnson thing... KUDLOW: President Obama mocked the Republican freeze on regulations at the press conference today. I just want to put that in. He mocked. Mr. WELCH: He's shown no ability to lead. Let's talk about that. But let's just take this point. Let's just take freezing regulations until we get unemployment below 6 percent. So, you know, we--just freeze them. The third thing, entitlements. Go after means testing. Lower the age for those below 50. Increase the age till they can get it. Means test. I shouldn't be getting Social Security. I shouldn't be getting Medicare benefits at the level I'm getting them. I mean... KUDLOW: This would provide some confidence, is what you're saying, right? Mr. WELCH: Larry... KUDLOW: Let me come back to taxes. Is it time to raise the tax rates on the upper income? Mr. WELCH: There's nothing that says it should. KUDLOW: OK. Mr. WELCH: All it is a transfer payment. KUDLOW: Right. Mr. WELCH: Take it from one hand, give it the other hand. Doesn't work. KUDLOW: And I think a lot of people are skeptical. So you raise taxes on millionaires, which sounds good. `Hey, get the millionaire. I'll feel better if a millionaire gets hurt.' It'll be spent on spending. It won't be used for debt reduction. Isn't that the possibility here? Mr. WELCH: Everything's going to be spend on spending. KUDLOW: Yeah. Mr. WELCH: I mean, they are spenders. They believe government should do more. They don't believe jobs come from the private sector. They believe government creates jobs. That's just a fundamental difference. KUDLOW: So another part of his news conference today, he was asked about the so-called Wall Street Occupiers, the Wall Street protesters, that's going on around the country and predominantly here but not only here. He expressed a lot of sympathy for that group. And I want to ask you, those guys are against the banks, they're against financial institutions, they're against a lot of things to do with capitalism. Are we going to live through a period of kind of left-wing populism where we're bashing millionaires and billionaires, we're bashing banks, we're bashing corporations, we're bashing Wall Street, we're bashing, you know, Bank of America for raising its debit card fees. Is that the way this election period is going to go? And how's it going to affect the economy? Mr. WELCH: Well, that's all bad news. But it would be solved if we had jobs. KUDLOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. WELCH: I mean, these people have a case. Unemployment at 9 percent. The president promised 6 percent, Larry, in October of '11. That's—nobody goes back and looks at the pledge they made. KUDLOW: Where did it fail? Where did that plan break down? Mr. WELCH: Shovel-ready jobs. People were ready to go, but we had a couple things wrong. Davis-Bacon wages, that changed the class structure. Buy America. A lot of these jobs--and with a penalty if you didn't. So a lot of these jobs, they weren't ready. From the cup to the lip was a much bigger distance. And then to put regulations on top of the stimulus. KUDLOW: So how do we stop this demoralization, to use Governor Christie's word? How do we get back to the Steve Jobs optimism, entrepreneurial model of economic growth? It worked for Jobs, it worked for this whole country. How can we preserve that spirit of Steve Jobs? Mr. WELCH: Larry, companies--I just had a review of my 12 companies in the last week--they're on fire. They're growing revenues at 7 percent average, the 12 companies. Their EBITDA is up double digits, strong double digits in some cases. This economy doing more with less is not good for jobs because it's not growing fast enough. It's growing at a 1 to 2 percent range. We got to get it to 3 to 4, and that's unshackling this government away from it. When I take out 25 percent of the discretionary spending, the same way we did in GE 20 years ago, guess what it does? You give them a soft landing, you take care of the people who are injured. You--we've got a balance sheet to do that. But when they come to work, they don't come to work and say, `What can I do today?' It's when they come to work they cause problem, not the cost of them. KUDLOW: And you're sending a signal. There's a confidence signal... Mr. WELCH: Yeah. And we're going to unshackle business. KUDLOW: All right. So unshackling business, reforming the corporate tax code, freezing regulations. Some tough spending measures from Jack Welch. Who fits the bill for all this in the Republican presidential primary sweepstakes right now? Who are you backing? Can you tell me? Mr. WELCH: Yeah, I'm backing Mitt Romney. Now, whether or not he takes the whole platform, because I want to drill, too. I want to drill on nongovernment land and I want to get royalties from that that are going to help lower the deficit. And I want to have by 2020 total energy independence not from renewables. I want to still support renewables. You don't stop that, but I want to really unleash the energy-driven sector in this economy. KUDLOW: I thought Romney was a greenie. He flirted with cap and trade when he was the governor of Massachusetts. Mr. WELCH: I said he may not follow my whole platform. KUDLOW: What about--what about Governor Perry. Last question, what about Herman Cain, who's actually going to appear on the show later? Mr. WELCH: I hope Herman Cain's serious. I don't think he's serious. I think he's got a book tour he's on, OK, and... KUDLOW: Well, I'm going to ask him that. Mr. WELCH: Yeah. KUDLOW: OK, I'm going to ask him if that's the case. Mr. WELCH: Well, that's one... KUDLOW: But if he were serious, could you back him? Mr. WELCH: I'm afraid he's not electable, and I'm afraid--I think--I think Romney, by the way, will have more trouble in the primary than he will in the general. KUDLOW: So you're looking for a defeat of Obama? Mr. WELCH: I want to take this administration out. They don't understand how to create jobs. They don't understand to grow this—America is on fire. America is still the greatest country in the world. And we have everything going for us except a government that is not supportive of capitalism. KUDLOW: All right. I hear you. We'll leave it right there. Mr. Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric and just a famed businessman and adviser.  Questions? Comments, send your emails to: lkudlow@kudlow.com"

2011-11-17,Will Stocks Resist 'Anything but Utmost Catastrophe'?,0.01549707602339181,"Stock markets have taken such a beating over the past few months that they are now more resilient to any upheavals, apart from a complete breakdown of the euro zone, an analyst told CNBC Thursday.""We've managed to get through all of these bond auctions in all of these markets with some measure of success.A failure would be a setback but even then it's not too critical,"" Richard Harris, CEO at Quam Asset Management.""Equity markets have been really beaten down over the last six months to a year and they now look reasonably resistant to anything but utmost catastrophe,"" he said.However, he conceded that there was still a long way to go before Europe's debt crisis was resolved with the situation more like being 'one step up and two steps down'.""We have to jump through a lot of hurdles over the next three or four months, we have the bond auctions today, the Spanish elections will be very interesting, which might not be conclusive on Sunday, you have a whole bunch of technocrats and I am sure the French triple A (rating) is going to go sometime and that will be another blow to markets,"" he added.Both Spain and France held unimpressive bond auctions Thursday - some bond yields hit euro-era highs -as fears that the crisis would engulf the bigger euro zone economies persisted. He said that it was now likely that the euro would survive with the worst case being the loss of a few countries despite European leaders adopting the 'sticking plaster' over the wound method rather than seeking an outright fix.Steven Bell, chief economist at GLC, disagreed saying the situation in Europe was now so serious it threatened even Germany, whose ""economic miracle"" Bell said was now at an end.""The end game for this may be Germany shouldering the financial responsibility for this, yet every time a crack appears in Spain or Italy or anywhere else people buy Bunds.Now the only thing you can hold in Europe is Bunds. That is a ridiculous situation,"" Bell told CNBC.He said German banks and companies were suffering to the point where Germany was now in a recession.""This is entirely and completely a result of failing to sort out this European crisis. I'm not optimistic about the ability of Europe's many and varied political leaders to come to that solution quickly,"" Bell added."
2011-11-18,"EU, Iran to Impact Crude Oil Prices, Experts Say",0.006393939393939394,"Crude oil prices in the short-term future will likely hinge on several factors, including the European debt crisis and the situation in Iran, traders said Friday on “Fast Money.” Crude soared to $103 a barrel earlier this week and dropped to $98 in midday trading. “We haven’t been talking about Iran when oil is concerned so that’s always the headline risk,” trader Steve Grasso said. “I would expect it to sell off a bit and then rally a bit over the next couple of weeks back toward that $100 mark.” Such an intense focus on Europe, which experienced turbulence from disappointing bond results in Spain this week, has drawn attention away from the Persian Gulf. “As soon as you start focusing more on Iran, I think you get that goosebump back up to par,” Grasso said. The European outlook isn’t good and will have a lasting effect, said trader Stephen Weiss. (Related Story: Technicals, Euro Debt Fears Driving This Market)“Europe is going into recession. I think it’ll be in a deep recession,” he said. “That’s going to hit demand, and China’s just going to bump along. ... Oil has a better chance going into the 80s than it does breaking $100.”Trader Zach Karabell added, ""Oil stocks and oil services stocks are clearly in the camp of oil-is-going-to-come-down because they clearly have not reflected the rising price of oil, at least in the current equity action.""______________________________________________________Got something to to say?

2011-11-28,Starting a Business: The Romance vs. the Reality ,0.05651364838864839,"Some people who toil discontentedly in corporate cubicles regard entrepreneurship as the cure for all workplace ills. Only when they’ve experienced running a business personally do they find that the reality is much different.Mike Cleary, for example, left his job as a sales and marketing executive to become an entrepreneur because he was tired of office politics. But after buying a franchise and an existing business about eight years ago, Cleary sparred with difficult vendors and suppliers. “It seemed very one-sided, with many commitments and obligations on my part, and much less required of the people I was buying from,” he said.In an effort to establish trust, he says, he extended credit to a client of the previous owner. Unfortunately, he says, the client was not forthcoming with payment, costing him tens of thousands of dollars in lost revenue.The Hiring HurdleFinding loyal employees was no picnic, either. “It was a harsh wake-up call,” said Cleary, adding, “to find out how many employees are not truly committed to the business they’re working for.”The recent recession was particularly hard on the revenue and cash flow of his small business. Eventually, he found himself too deeply in debt to continue, and he returned to working for an established organization.Today, he is content in his role as senior vice president for strategic marketing and field operations at the National Wild Turkey Federation in Edgefield, S.C., where he feels that he is living his personal mission to help conserve natural habitats. “I love that I’m finally in a position to worry about the high-level strategy instead of the other stuff, which just sapped my energy,” Cleary said. “It’s really freeing.”Many prospective entrepreneurs fail to realize that office politics are everywhere, and that you can’t escape them when you strike out on your own. You may still have to contend with rude clients and partners, with many situations feeling eerily similar to those of your days by the water cooler. And you often learn the hard way that people tend to clash regardless of the environment.Challenges to an Entrepreneurial PathThere are other reasons you may want to steer clear of the entrepreneurial path. First, there’s the sheer difficulty of finding a market niche for your product or service, as well as the proper resources to make a new business happen. Then there are the minutiae. As the founder, you will find that anything and everything is your responsibility. You will oversee production, distribution, marketing, sales and turning a profit. You’ll have to manage employees and vendors, and pesky details like accounting, taxes, insurance and licenses.Would-be entrepreneurs who want to have a better work-life balance are in for a rude awakening. For at least the first few years, you may be on the job at all hours. If a customer has a problem in the middle of the night, you are the one who’s getting up to address it. And if the company goes under, you are solely accountable for that failure, sacrificing your financial livelihood in the process.These days, the traditional business world gets a bad rap. But there are some highly valuable aspects of regular jobs that we don’t think about until they are gone. These are the three P’s: peace, prestige and perks.When you are one employee out of 1,000 or 100,000, you have much more peace. It’s actually possible to leave your work woes at the office and turn off your BlackBerry without jeopardizing the company’s future. Life is simpler. You have a defined set of responsibilities, and if you carry them out well and get results, you can go about your business with the certainty that the rest of the company can take care of itself.And if you are intelligent and personable, you can rise to a respectable place in an esteemed organization. Your friends and family won’t fidget nervously when you tell them about your job. Being able to put a known company on your résumé equals credibility and opens career doors.Remember the PerksFinally, don’t forget about the perks. At a large organization, your compensation package is just that: a package. Besides base salary, the money your employer contributes to your health insurance and retirement plans can be essential to surviving in today’s world. And don’t discount the value of possible benefits like cars, gym memberships, child care, on-the-job lunches and big discounts on company products.The corporate world also gives you the opportunity to be around lots of people all the time. And, inevitably, some will be executives in a position to help with your career. The ability to establish relationships with powerful people in the context of your daily work is the best kind of networking out there.The entrepreneurial lifestyle isn’t for everyone. It wasn’t for Cleary, and it may not be for you. Before you decide to take the plunge, think long and hard about what you’ll be getting yourself into, and what you’ll be giving up."
2012-01-18,Porn and the Condom Conundrum ,0.11853775853775854,"Los Angeles may be about to lose its title as the US porn capital. The L.A. City Council voted Tuesday to make condom use mandatory in adult films. And adult studios are already planning how to minimize the effects of that law.Technically, the legislation, which will tie mandatory condom use on set to city film permit approvals for porn shoots, needs to first be approved by the city's mayor — and won't go into effect until police officials, the city attorney and others figure out how it might be enforced. That gives adult entertainment companies time to adapt. And some of the biggest studios say the first option is to relocate production to other areas. ""[Studios] will move out of the city of L.A. and they'll stop shooting here,"" says Steven Hirsch, founder and co-chairman of Vivid Entertainment, the industry's largest studio. ""There's no question of that. … I'm not sure what they're going to accomplish aside from kicking the industry outside of the city "" Hirsch estimates porn studios have shot over 300,000 scenes in the past six years, with the majority of those being filmed in the L.A. area. (The San Fernando Valley is nicknamed ""Porn Valley"" because of the industry's tight concentration there.) A filming permit in L.A. carries a basic application fee of $625 and usually comes with additional costs, depending on location and the activities filmed. That makes the porn industry a notable source of revenue for the city. Scott Taylor, founder of New Sensations, says his company will comply with the law for L.A. shoots, but he, too, expects to move filming outside the city. ""L.A. County does have borders and if we need to adapt, we will,"" he says. ""It's a real pain to do so, but we will have to find off-the-beaten-path locations."" One location that could become a new favorite is Las Vegas. The town that bills itself ""Sin City"" is already a second home to the porn industry, playing host to its annual convention each year. Additionally, there are tax savings to be had by shooting there that could cover some of the expenses of moving production to the area. Ultimately, say studio executives, the decision on where to focus shooting if they do move productions outside of L.A. will depend on where the performers settle. The decision to make condom use mandatory for adult actors is a notable winfor the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which has been lobbying for it for some time. The Free Speech Coalition, the porn industry's trade association, criticized the vote. A legal challenge is possible, though isn't certain, say insiders. And the porn exodus might not stop at filming locations. Hirsch says Vivid hasn't made any final decisions but is not opposed to relocating to another city if performers begin to settle in a new territory. That's a move of last resort, of course. Moving a company to another state carries a lot of expense — and for a studio as diversified as Vivid or New Sensations, it's not always practical.Taylor, for instance, says he has no plans to leave L.A. ""I have a multitude of businesses,"" he says. ""I have a distribution facility that puts the products in stores and an Internet division that handles a lot of digital sites, so uprooting that core and moving it really isn't realistic."" Smaller studios, though, might be more willing to uproot. Or, alternatively, they might simply ignore the regulations or film without permits — as many currently do. ""There will be many smaller companies that will go ahead and shoot anyway,"" notes Hirsch. ""Some people will shoot their movies regardless."" Some porn studios, meanwhile, won't be affected at all by the law. Girlfriend Films, which specializes in lesbian movies, won't have to change its practices. And Wicked Pictures has maintained a condoms-only policy since 2004, putting it in compliance with the new legislation."
2012-01-23,Foreclosure Investors are Double-Edged Sword ,0.1357532857532857,"The best and most expeditious way to clear the vast inventory of foreclosed properties weighing down today’s housing market is to get more investors in and sell them these properties at bulk discounts. That’s what the Obama administration and Federal regulators are currently considering for the thousands of homes currently owned by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHA. While big private equity fundsare still largely in a very tedious deal-making stage with banks or waiting on the sidelines for a government program, smaller individual investors are getting in. Nearly 23 percent of home purchases in December were by investors, according to a new survey from Campbell/Inside Mortgage Finance. That is a slight increase from November, but the share has remained largely unchanged for the past year. What has changed dramatically is how many of these investors are using all-cash…74 percent according to the survey, which also found that, “cash buyers are able to bid significantly lower—and successfully—on many properties because they offer a shorter and more reliable closing timeline.” That is precisely what mortgage servicers want. “While investor bids may not be the first offers accepted, they often end up winning properties after other homebuyers are eliminated because of mortgage approval or timeline problems,” according to the survey authors. “Appraisals below the contracted price are a common reason for mortgage denials. Most mortgage financing timelines are now in excess of 30 days.” There has been a lot of concern among industry analysts that bulk foreclosure sales would push home prices down further, but it appears that is already happening, as investors usually offer 10-20 percent below list price, while first time home buyers and current homeowners are generally offering list. If the offers are competitive, cash will prevail. Questions?  Comments?  RealtyCheck@cnbc.comAnd follow me on"
2012-01-25,What Apple’s $100 Billion Really Means ,0.15521604938271605,"Apple’s jaw-dropping announcement that it had nearly $100 billion in cash on hand at the end of the last quarter has many people scrambling for ideas about what Apple should do with all that loot.Apple said this week it ended the last quarter and the year with $97.6 billion in cash, to be exact — much of it held overseas for tax purposes. By comparison, that's twice as much cash as Google, which ended the year with $44.6 billion in the bank. Apple officials said the company is discussing ways to use the cash.  There’s some speculation that they could use it to build out the supply chain, lending money to their suppliers to bolster productivity, or perhaps increase their investment in Apple TV. Many investors, of course, would like the see the company pay a dividend. But the low multiple to earnings suggests that the market doesn’t see this in the offing. The main problem with a company that has accumulated a huge amount of cash is the temptation to do something foolish with it. Acquisitions, for instance, tend to increase when companies find themselves with an abundance of cash.  This seems unlikely in the case of Apple, since there appears to be few acquisition opportunities that wouldn’t raise antitrust concerns. What most people do not appreciate about cash is that it is a strategic asset. Cash holdings might appear to do nothing in good times, but when credit constricts or markets wobble — and usually these things happen together — he who lives with the most cash wins. It's tempting to think of Apple's cash hoard as a shield it can hide behind in tough times. But that's not quite right. It's more like a sword — a weapon to strike against weaker rivals. Companies with large cash holdings are reliably able to capture market share from cash-constrained competitors. Where the cash-poor competitors are forced to cut costs, reduce marketing and slow expansion if consumer demand slows, the cash rich can pour even more resources into hiring, marketing and development. They can use a crisis as an opportunity. This is competition at its bloodiest. You can see why so many of the other top tech companies — such as Google  and Microsoft — are also accumulating cash. They are all attempting to assure that if global markets take a downturn, they can keep flying high. Questions? Comments?

2012-03-16,"Global Markets Up, but Where Is the Retail Investor?",0.1366496598639456,"Tamer inflation (somewhat): The dollar dropped, stock futures rose a point or so, as February Consumer Price Index came in at 0.4 percent, in line with expectations, with core at 0.1 percent, slightly below expectations.Yields on the 10-year Treasury moved up to 2.33 percent. This has been a big week for bonds: The 10-year closed last Friday at 2.029 percent, it's up 15 percent in five days. Stocks rally: The U.S. isn't the only stock market at new highs. The major stock indicies in Germany, France, the U.K., and Japan are at their best levels since July. Elsewhere:1) Where's the retail investor? Indices at new highs, but only modest retail interest. It's a cliché by now: Retail investors have been taking money out of stocks since, oh, 2008. Almost every week last year, there were net outflows. Now the major indices are back at multiyear highs. What's the story with retail investors? If you look at the Lipper (AMG) equity fund flow numbers so far this year, it looks fairly positive: The four-week average for weekly equity flows shows inflows of anywhere from $600 million to $4.5 billion...healthy! But look below the hood: If you remove exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , there are still inflows, but they are much more modest....anywhere from $200 million to $800 million. Why look at equity flows ex-ETFs? Because ETFs are still largely used by professionals...not exclusively, of course, but largely. Bottom line: Retail investors are still only slowly warming to stocks. But it's a start. 2) Global markets this week: Moving up!

2012-03-26,Prepare for an Oil Shock With Currencies,0.05642135642135642,"There is a lot of tough talk emanating from the Middle East. Here's a currency-trading plan in case the situation worsens.With all the news about oil output and rumors of possible military action in the Middle East, it's a good idea to have a trading plan in the event of an oil shock. Rebecca Patterson, chief markets strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Institutional, is looking north for her plan. ""If you are trading currencies and you see a headline go across the tape saying something has happened, what's the first thing you should do? If it's a supply shock, I want to go with a current account surplus country. I want to be long the Norwegian krone,"" she told CNBC's Melissa Lee.To keep the trade liquid, Patterson suggests using the euro  as a cross. Also, because ""we don't know what levels we'll be at if and when this happens,"" she says, ""we're just going to use where we are now as an example.""So for now, Patterson suggests entering the trade right around 7.6200, with a stop at 7.4000 and a target of 7.7000. Todd Gordon, co-head of research and trading at Aspen Trading Group, says the trade measures up nicely in technical terms. And Patterson adds that it's not just the oil issue that could make this trade work. ""Norway has a current account surplus. If equities fall this week and people take risk off, that could also benefit Norway at the margin.""You can watch the discussion on this video.--------------CURRENCY FUTURESTune In: CNBC's ""Money in Motion Currency Trading"" airs on Fridays at 5:30pm and repeats on Saturdays at 7pm.

2012-04-16,"Market Anxiety Hits Transports, Russell 2000, Nasdaq",0.060236865407319956,"Apple as a non-confirmation? It started in the middle of February: Transports failed to keep advancing with the Industrials. At the time, the failure was blamed on higher fuel prices; indeed, oil prices hit a 10-month high as we closed out that month.That was the first non-confirmation that got bears going. Then, as we moved into a new quarter in April, it was noted that the small-cap Russell 2000 began underperforming the S&P 500. It is a modest underperformance (down 4.7 percent for the month vs. the down 2.9 percent S&P underperformance) but it too has been seized upon by bears as a sign that U.S. growth — even with modest expectations of 2.5 percent GDP growth — may be moderating. Now, the Nasdaq — which has dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 all year (up 14.5 percent vs. 8.7 percent), is underperforming — but only for today. Volume on the Nasdaq is slightly higher than normal. It's not just Apple , plenty of other companies like Seagate, Broadcomm and even Netflix have turned in stellar performances this year. I know everyone is worried about AAPL down 5 days in a row, but this is the first day the Nasdaq has significantly underperformed. It's a sign of the power of AAPL that even a one-day drop has traders wondering. This is tricky. Apple, by traditional valuation metrics, is not overpriced. But the investor concentration in the name, along with a 50 percent runup in a little more than three months, has got many nervous. And the bears have noted for weeks that estimates — and price targets — for AAPL have continued to climb. Glass half empty? Economic data very mixed this morning: positive retail sales, but the Street is concentrating on the lower than expected housing and Empire Manufacturing figures. The National Association of Home Builders Sentiment Index got an unusual amount of commentary this week, largely because of this comment from Chief Economist David Crowe: ""Interest expressed by buyers in the past few months has yet to translate into expected sales activity."" Not all negative news: Reliance Steel   this morning increased its Q1 guidance to $1.50, well above prior guidance of $1.22-$1.40 and above consensus of $1.29. CEO David Hanna attributed the higher guidance to better pricing and ""somewhat stronger"" demand.

2012-06-11,Surge in Products Being Recalled May Be Numbing Consumers,0.07341200018619372,"U.S. regulators, retailers and manufacturers are growing increasingly concerned that a surge in the number of products being recalled is resulting in ""fatigue"" by the public — increasing the chance that consumers could ignore or miss a recall that could ultimately endanger their health. Consumers last year were deluged with 2,363 recalls, or about 6.5 recalls each day, covering consumer products, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food, according to data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The recalls announced mark a nearly 14 percent increase from 2,081 in 2010 and compare with about 1,460 in 2007.Experts say the increase is the result of a combination of greater oversight by regulators, better testing procedures and the use of social media where consumers can quickly point out and discuss problems with other people. ""We're experiencing recall fatigue in my mind at the consumer level and also perhaps at the business level, and we all have to worry about that,"" said Mike Rozembajgier, vice president of recalls for Stericycle ExpertRecall, an Indianapolis-based firm which has provided advice and helped major U.S. companies, including Merck, General Electricand Wendy's, carry out recalls. ""We have this growing concern for safety, but with there being so many recalls going on (is the public) paying attention to them and responding to them in a manner that is necessary for the recalls to be handled effectively?"" he said. This year alone hundreds of recalls have already been announced. Pfizerrecalled birth control pills after it was found there may have been an inexact number of pills that also could have been out of sequence, increasing the chance of an unintended pregnancy. asked its customers to return about 169,000 high chairs because the restraint buckle could open unexpectedly. And Dole warned the public not to eat a lettuce salad mix because of a possible health risk from salmonella. Retailers and government regulators are increasingly struggling to reach people who may not know about a recall, or choose to ignore it despite the potential dangers. A 2009 study conducted by Rutgers found 12% of Americans ate food they knew had been recalled and 40% admitted never having looked for recalled products in their homes. Increasingly, retailers and government agencies are expanding the methods they use to communicate with the public — from social-media technologies such as Twitter and Facebook to more traditional methods such as phone calls and postings within their stores. But the same methods that prove successful in reaching one customer could just as easily be ignored by another. ""We don't feel that our members are getting bombarded but certainly the general public is and sooner or later you don't know what to believe,"" said Craig Wilson, vice president for quality assurance and food safety at the warehouse giant Costco  . The 602-store warehouse chain uses data supplied from its estimated 60 million members and notifies them within 24 hours if they've purchased a recalled item. It then follows up with a letter. The result is that customers return about 90% of recently recalled products and, in the case of major recalls such as when a food product could cause serious health problems or death, Costco gets ""the majority of everything that was sold back."" But Wilson says the national recall system ""doesn't work as designed"" and that consumers and retailers alike would benefit from a single, uniform network. He says the CPSC, USDA and FDA each have a different recall system with unique requirements, making it more difficult for companies like his to make sure they are complying with the rules. At Rochester, New York-based Wegmans, the grocery chain has a detailed recall plan that can require hundreds of people to carry out. The 81-store East Coast chain follows a recall protocol increasingly common among retailers: posting recall information on its web page and within stores for customers, notifying its followers using social media tools and, when possible, calling individuals who may have used a store card for the purchase. ""We do what we can to protect our customers but then our customers have to protect themselves and they can't do that unless they have the information,"" said Jeanne Colleluori with Wegmans. Last year alone, Colleluori said Wegmans participated in about 40 recalls, and the retailer was ahead of that pace in 2012 with about 16 recalls as of early May. Businesses can ease the burden of a recall on their reputation and bottom line by being honest and upfront with their customers and crafting a response plan before any recall occurs that outlines what they will do with the public, media and regulators, industry watchers say. ""Many companies are being criticized not because they are not doing the right thing but because they are taking too long,"" said Sophie Ann Terrisse, chief executive of STC Associates, a brand-management firm. She said some firms fail to estimate the work needed to conduct a recall and quickly become overwhelmed, leading to slow responses or poor customer service from representatives who don't have the time or know how to respond properly. ""Things can get out of hand very quickly and it's hard to recover from that"" for the brand and the company's core audience, said Terrisse. Companies involved in recalls all say their primary concern is protecting the public — but they also have a business interest as well. ""Our concern is for our customers but we have to protect our name as well, and we are very much aware that when there is a recall if it is a Wegmans brand product our reputation is at stake,"" said Wegmans' Colleluori. Some businesses have managed to take a recall and turn it into a marketing bonanza that benefits the company. Two years ago McDonald's took the unusual step of paying customers a premium to return Shrek glasses to the restaurants following concerns that paint used to depict characters on the glasses contained cadmium — a carcinogen known to cause kidney problems. ""Mistakes can be made, but the way they are dealt with is by being completely open and letting the customer become part of the recall,"" said Terrisse. For Stericycle ExpertRecall's Rozembajgier, the recall surge has turned into a lucrative business for his company, the largest U.S. firm handing consumer product, food and pharmaceutical recalls. The firm has its hands in nearly every stage of the process from storing a recalled product, helping warehouses and stores remove the item from shelves, dealing with customers and ensuring the company conducting the recall is complying with guidelines set out by U.S. regulators. At its five warehouses in Indianapolis totaling 700,000 square feet (about 12 football fields), the firm collects and stores recalled items — everything from household appliance components to sporting/recreational equipment to jewelry. In fact, eight years after Merck voluntarily recalled Vioxx, Stericycle ExpertRecall still has a full side of a warehouse stacked floor to ceiling with cases of the arthritis drug. There are still a number of lawsuits pending, and Stericycle ExpertRecall must keep the drug under lock and key until the FDA says it can be destroyed. ""Recalled products come here to die,"" said Rozembajgier, whose firm has been involved in nearly 3,000 recalls during the last decade. ""If they come to Indianapolis they're not getting back into the supply chain."" The firm has started to recycle some of the recalled items. For example, it has recycled the batteries and plastic components from recalled medical devices; copper from the wiring in electrical products; and sugar has been extracted from liquid medication. The government operates a recalled website, http://recalls.gov/, which offers the public information on all recalls including cars, boats, food, consumer products, medicine and cosmetics. The U.S. Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service improved its recall system in March by rolling out a Twitter feed that targets consumers only if their state is impacted. In the past, FSIS would send out a Tweet to the 250,000 people who follow everything that happens at the agency. USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack downplayed the number of recalls that are announced considering the number of products that are produced, items that are sold and meals consumed each day. ""I think people want to know and need to know and have a right to know if there is a problem with a particular product,"" said Vilsack. ""We're going to look at ways in which we (communicate) and constantly improve how we communicate but we're not going to stop communicating."" This story first appeared in USA Today."
2012-06-22,"Wealth Gap Rises Between Whites, Non-Whites",0.11785714285714285,"People like to talk about “the wealth gap” as relating only to the one percent and the 99. But there are actually multiple wealth gaps emerging – by age, gender and now, by race.According to a study by the Census Bureau, the wealth gap between whites, Hispanics and black Americans grew during the recession.Between 2005 and 2010, the media net worth of white Americans (non-Hispanic) fell 15 percent, to $110,729. The median net worth of black Americans fell 55 percent to $4,955. And the median net worth of Hispanic Americans fell 56 percent, to $7,424. The net worth of Asians fell 54 percent, to $69,590.Asians and whites lost more in absolute terms, with Asian median wealth dropping by $83,000 while whites lost $20,000. That compares to a loss of about $6,000 for blacks and $10,000 for Hispanics. Yet because whites' and Asians' net-worths are higher, their percentage losses were lower.What accounts for this widening wealth-race gap?The main contributor is home ownership and wealth portfolios. Historically speaking, homes make up a larger share of wealth for black and Hispanics.  Whites have a greater share of wealth in other assets, like stocks, mutual funds and other financial instruments.Because financial assets have recovered from the recession more strongly than home prices, wealth for whites also recovered more rapidly.Blacks and Hispanics have also suffered from higher unemployment than whites. The unemployment rate for whites is around 7.4 percent; it’s nearly twice that level for blacks.Just to be clear, the study doesn’t show that race is a cause of these disparities. But it is clear that in strict economic terms, the wealth gap in America is growing between the races.Do you think there are other reasons that the wealth gap between races is growing?-By CNBC's Robert FrankFollow Robert Frank on Twitter: @robtfrank"

Goldman expects expect that to continue, making it even harder for hedge funds to reverse this trend in the second half.“We continue to expect a slow recovery in the stock-picking environment as macro growth concerns and event risks dominate the investment environment,” wrote Goldman’s Stuart Kaiser, in a note.Funds from notable hedge fund managers such asJohn Paulson, Daniel Loeb and David Einhorn underperformed the market in the first half.Einhorn, in an interview with CNBC, implied that the Federal Reserve’s policy of zero interest rates is making it difficult for everybody.“I think it is actually counterproductive having very low zero rates,” said the manager of Greenlight Capital. “It is sort of just depressing to people. I think it deprives savers of reasonable incomes and the ability to forecast.”It also pushes investors out the risk curve into alternative investments like hedge funds, a losing proposition so far this year.“This shows that investors need a mixed basket of investments, some fixed income, some long stock and some alternative investments,” said Brian Stutland of Stutland Volatility Group.For the best market insight, catch 'Fast Money' each night at 5pm ET, and the ‘Halftime Report’ each afternoon at 12:00 ET on CNBC.

2012-07-18,5 Stocks Insiders Love Right Now,0.06475093318068523,"Corporate insiders sell their own companies' stock for a number of reasons. They might need the cash for a big personal purchase such as a new house or yacht, or they might need the cash to fund a charity. Sometimes they sell as part of a planned selling program that they have put in place for diversification purposes, which allows them to sell stock in stages instead of selling all at one price. Other times they sell because they think their stock is overvalued and the risk/reward is no longer attractive. Some even dump their own stock because they have inside knowledge that a competitor is eating their lunch and stealing market share. But insiders usually buy their own shares for one reason: They think the stock is a bargain and has tremendous upside.   The key word in that last statement is “think.” Just because a corporate insider thinks his or her stock is going to trade higher, that doesn’t mean it will play out that way. Insiders can have all the conviction in the world that their stock is a buy, but if the market doesn’t agree with them, the stock could end up going nowhere. Also, I say “usually” because sometimes insiders are loaned money by the company to buy their own stock. Those loans are often sweetheart deals and shouldn’t be viewed as organic insider buying. At the end of the day, its large institutional money managers running big mutual funds and hedge funds that drive stock prices, not insiders. That said, many of these savvy stock operators will follow insider buying activity when they agree with the insider that the stock is undervalued and has upside potential. This is why it’s so important to always be monitoring insider activity, but it’s twice as important to make sure the trend of the stock coincides with the insider buying. Recently, a number of companies’ corporate insiders have bought large amounts of stock. These insiders are finding some value in the market, which warrants a closer look at these stocks. Here’s a look at several stocks that insiders have been doing some big guying in per Securities and Exchange Commission filings.1. IMAXOne stock that insiders are snapping up a huge amount of is Imax, which, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, operates as an entertainment technology company specializing in motion picture technologies and presentations worldwide. Insiders are loading up on this stock into strength, since shares are up a whopping 38 percent so far in 2012. Imax has a market capitalization of $1.67 billion and an enterprise value of $1.62 billion. This stock trades at a premium valuation, with a trailing price-to-earnings of 89 and a forward price-to-earnings of 22.38. Its estimated growth rate for this year is 135 percent, and for next year it’s pegged at 21.3 percent. This is not a cash-rich company, since the total cash position on its balance sheet is $21.59 million, and its total debt is $55 million. A beneficial owner just bought 183,600 shares, or about $4.3 million worth of stock, at $22.62 to $24.11 per share. This same beneficial owner also just bought 326,400 shares, or about $7.49 million worth of stock, at $22.91 to $23.04 per share. From a technical perspective, IMAX is currently trading above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which is bullish. This stock recently bounced right off its 50-day at $22.50 a share, and it has now started enter breakout territory, with the stock moving above some near-term overhead resistance at $25.12 to $25.34 a share. That move started on Tuesday, and it was accompanied by massive upside volume of 3.34 million shares. If you’re bullish on IMAX, then I would look for long-biased trades once it triggers its next major breakout trade above some past overhead resistance levels at $26.48 to $26.68 a share with high volume. Look for volume on that breakout that registers near or above its three-month average action of 1.3 million shares. If we get that move soon, then IMAX could easily spike north of $30 a share. I would avoid IMAX or look for short-baized trades if it fails to hold that near-term breakout over $25.12 to $25.34 a share, and then drops back below its 50-day at $22.50 and 200-day at $21.58 with high volume. If we get that action, then look for IMAX to trend back below $20 a share. 2. Synageva BioPharmaIn the biotechnology and drugs complex, insiders are loading up on Synageva BioPharma, which is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapeutic products for patients with life-threatening rare diseases and unmet medical needs. Insiders are buying this stock into some big-time strength here, since shares are up over 80% so far in 2012. Synageva has a market cap of $1.04 billion and an enterprise value of $903 million. This stock trades at a premium valuation, with a price-to-sales of 235.20 and a price-to-book of 6.85. Its estimated growth rate for this year is 78.6%, and for next year it's pegged at — 51.10 percent. This is a cash-rich company, since the total cash position on its balance sheet is $138.92 million, and its total debt is zero.A director and beneficial owner just bought 886,000 shares, or about $36.5 million worth of stock, at $41.20 per share. Another director also just bought 73,000 shares, or about $3 million worth of stock, at $41.20 per share. From a technical perspective, Synageva is currently trading above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which is bullish. This stock triggered a major breakout trade back in late June once it started to move above some past overhead resistance at $40.38 with massive upside volume. Following that trigger, shares of Synageva pulled back briefly to around $40 a share, and then took off to hit its recent 52-week high of $49.93 a share. That move has started to push Synageva into overbought territory, since its current relative strength index reading is 80.42. If you’re in the bull camp on Synageva, then I would wait for this stock to pullback significantly since it’s extended by almost 10 points above its 50-day moving average of $39.28 a share, and it’s almost 20 points above its 200-day moving average of $30.36 a share. Look for a buying opportunity in Synageva once it pulls back closer to its 50-day moving average of $39.28 a share, at let’s say $42 to $40 a share if we get it. 3. Deckers OutdoorInsiders are also snapping up a large amount of stock in Deckers Outdoor, a designer, producer, marketer, and brand manager of footwear, apparel, and accessories. Insiders are sniffing out some deep value here, since this stock has traded down by over 35 percent so far in 2012. Deckers Outdoor has a market cap of $1.80 billion and an enterprise value of $1.55 billion. This stock trades at a cheap valuation, with a trailing price-to-earnings of 9.79 and a forward price-to-earnings of 8.62. Its estimated growth rate for this year is -11 percent, and for next year it’s pegged at 20.6 percent. This is a cash-rich company, since the total cash position on its balance sheet is $228.57 million, and its total debt is zero. The CEO just bought 10,000 shares, or around $459,000 worth of stock, at $45.90 per share. From a technical perspective, Deckers is currently trading below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which is bearish. This stock has been stuck in a nasty downtrend for the past eight months, with shares plunging from over $118.90 to a recent low of $42.16 a share. During that sharp move lower, shares of Deckers have consistently made lower highs and lower lows, which is bearish technical price action. That said, the stock has started to reverse that trend and make higher lows and some higher highs. That move is quickly pushing Deckers within range of triggering a near-term breakout trade.If you’re bullish on Deckers, then I would look for long-biased trades once this stock manages to clear some near-term overhead resistance at $48.41 a share, and then its 50-day moving average of $50.15 a share with high volume. Look for volume on that move that’s tracking in near or above its three-month average action of 1.9 million shares. If that breakout triggers soon, then Deckers could easily re-test and possibly take out its next significant overhead resistance levels of $54.88 to $59.07 a share. Keep in mind that we will need to see a high-volume trend above its 50-day to have any chance at hitting those targets. On the flipside, I would avoid Deckers or look for short-baized trades if the stock fails to trigger that breakout soon, and then takes out its near-term support zones at $45 to $43.92, plus its 52-week low of $42.15 a share with high volume. If we get that action, then Deckers could slide back below $40 a share if the bears gain full control of this stock. Keep in mind that it’s almost always bearish technical action when a stock continues to print new 52-week lows.4. Verifone SystemsAnother stock that insiders are finding attractive here is business equipment player VeriFone Systems, which is engaged in the secure electronic payment solutions. It provides solutions, and services for the financial, retail, hospitality, petroleum, transportation, government, and health-care vertical markets. Insiders are finding some deep value here, since this stock is down by over 33 percent in the last three months. VeriFone has a market cap of $3.84 billion and an enterprise value of $5.13 billion. This stock trades at a reasonable valuation, with a trailing price-to-earnings of 16.7 and a forward price-to-earnings of 10.96. Its estimated growth rate for this year is 38.5 percent, and for next year it's pegged at 22.2 percent. This is not a cash-rich company, since the total cash position on its balance sheet is $366.40 million, and its total debt is a whopping $1.61 billion. The CEO just bought 155,000 shares, or around $5.03 million worth of stock, at $32.50 per share. From a technical perspective, VeriFone is currently trading below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which is bearish. This stock got hammered back in April, with shares plunging from a high of $55.89 to a recent low of $30.10 a share. During that massive drop, shares of VeriFone were constantly making lower highs and lower lows, which is bearish technical price action. The stock also flashed a number of warning signs to longs with large gap downs on heavy volume. That said, the stock has started to find some buying interest near $30 to $32 a share, and it’s now making higher lows and higher highs. If you’re in the bull camp on VeriFone, I would look for long-biased trades if this stock can manage to trigger a near-term breakout trade above some overhead resistance levels at $36.78 to its 50-day moving average of $36.81 a share with high volume. Look for volume on that move that hits near or above its three-month average volume of 3.6 million shares. If we get that breakout soon, then VeriFone could start to fill a recent gap down that started near $44 a share. Some key levels to watch for are $40 a share which is near the low of the gap down day, and its 200-day moving average of $42.25 a share. If those levels get taken out with volume, then VeriFone could re-visit some more resistance at $47.82 a share. On the flipside, I would avoid VeriFone or look for short-biased trades if it fails to trigger that breakout soon, and then drops below some major near-term support at $34 a share with heavy volume. If we get that action, then VeriFone could head back towards $32 to $30 a share. Any future move below its 52-week low of $30.10 a share should be consider bearish price action, since most stocks that print new 52-week lows continue to do so for some time. 5. Hudson GlobalAnother stock with some interesting insider buying is Hudson Global, which provides specialized professional-level recruitment and related talent solutions worldwide. Insiders are buying this stock into some notable weakness, since shares are off by around 18 percent so far in 2012. Hudson Global has a market cap of $143 million and an enterprise value of $113.14 million. This stock trades at a reasonable valuation, with a trailing price-to-earnings of 18.71 and a forward price-to-earnings of 12.83. Its estimated growth rate for this year is -147.1 percent, and for next year it’s pegged at 318.8 percent. This is a cash-rich company, since the total cash position on its balance sheet is $24.93 million and its total debt is $1.04 million. A beneficial owner just bought 112,400 shares, or about $443,000 worth of stock, at $3.95 per share. The same beneficial owner also just bought 150,000 shares, or about $605,000 worth of stock, at $4.03 per share. From a technical perspective, Hudson is currently trading above its 50-day moving average and below its 200-day moving averages which is neutral trendwise. This stock took a dive off its April high of $5.98 to its recent low of $3.23 a share. During that large move lower, shares of Hudson were consistently making lower highs and lower lows, which is bearish technical price action. That said, the stock formed a double bottom in mid-June at around $3.23 to $3.30 a share. Since marking that bottom, shares of Hudson have soared back above its 50-day moving average of $3.96 a share. If you’re bullish on Hudson, then I would look for long-biased trades once this stock takes out its 200-day moving average of $4.61 a share with high volume. Look for volume on that move that registers near or above its three-month average action of 107,522 shares. If we get that move soon, then look for Hudson to trade back towards its next significant overhead resistance levels at $5.72 to $5.98 a share. It’s possible that Hudson could pull back to its 50-day at $3.96 a share before it challenges its 200-day. I would simply avoid Hudson if it fails to trigger that breakout, and then moves back below its 50-day moving average at $3.96 and some more near-term support at $3.78 a share with heavy volume. If we get that move, then Hudson could easily re-test its previous double bottom price levels at $3.30 to $3.32 a share. Any move below its 52-week low of $3.05 share should be considered bearish technical price action.—By TheStreet.com Contributor Roberto PedoneAdditional News: Lights. Camera. Invest!

2012-07-26,Romney Comment on Olympics Riles Britain ,0.027513984143197626,"Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney caused a stir in Britain on Thursday by questioning whether the country is prepared to host the Olympic Games without a hitch and scheduling a fundraiser with the former head of a troubled bank. The former Massachusetts governor visited with British political leaders as part of a larger effort to show he has what it takes to represent the U.S. on the world stage. But instead of highlighting ties with the America's staunchest ally, Romney may have embarrassed the Brits instead.British Prime Minister David Cameron offered a blunt retort to Romney and other doubters, saying they will ""see beyond doubt that Britain can deliver."" The stir came on the first full day of Romney's first international tour as the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee. With the U.S. still fighting one war and facing foreign policy challenges across the globe, Romney is seeking to convince American voters that he's prepared to serve as commander and chief, despite limited foreign policy experience. He is visiting three allies, including Israel and Poland, on the trip, appearing Friday at the Olympic opening ceremonies to help remind voters of his personal Olympic experience. Romney led the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, and used the games to launch his political career. But his foreign trip got off to a shaky start.  openly doubted whether Britain could handle the games, saying it was unclear whether issues that have dogged the final preparations could be overcome. ""It's hard to know just how well it will turn out,"" Romney told NBC News in an interview on Wednesday, two days before the opening ceremonies. He later met with Cameron and they discussed the Olympics as well as Afghanistan and Syria, among other countries. Romney declined to answer questions on whether the West should do more to intervene in Syria, suggesting that he didn't ""want to describe foreign policy positions I may have while I'm on foreign soil."" Earlier Thursday, Romney and Cameron seemed to address each other through the media after Romney doubted Britain's preparedness for the Olympics. Romney suggested it's impossible for any Olympic Games to go off without a hitch; Cameron said Romney and others would soon see that England is up to the challenge. Romney backed off his initial comment after meeting with Cameron. ""I expect the games to be highly successful,"" Romney declared after the meeting. At the same time, Romney faced scrutiny for a London fundraiser Thursday night that's expected to attract employees of Barclays, which has been in the spotlight after becoming the first bank to admit its employees were involved in manipulating a key interest rate. Last month, U.S. and British agencies fined Barclays a total of $453 million. In the wake of that shock, chief executive . Diamond had been scheduled to attend the fundraiser at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in the tony Knightsbridge district, but has pulled out. He already had sent Romney a check for $2,500. Romney sought to steer the conversation away from the controversies. ""The world is a tumultuous and dangerous place,"" Romney said Thursday. ""And certainly in many of the regions around the world we have great interests in having a common effort in seeing greater peace and prosperity."" As he met with British leaders past and present, the Republican also praised ""the unique relationship that exists between our nations, our commitment to common values, our commitment to peace in the world and a desire to see a stronger and growing economy."" Romney, whose decades in private business gave him ample exposure to international affairs, is a former one-term governor untested on the world's political stage. He hopes to convince voters back home that he is no novice on foreign affairs and that they should feel confident electing him as president in a complex world and with the U.S. facing a myriad of security threats. During the public portion of his meeting with Cameron, Romney weighed in again after his comment about the Olympics drew attention across Britain. ""It is impossible for absolutely no mistakes to occur,"" he said. ""Of course there will be errors from time to time, but those are all overshadowed by the extraordinary demonstrations of courage, character and determination by the athletes."" Meeting with British officials is typically one of the first priorities of any new president, and establishing those relationships beforehand can help smooth any transition. It's not unusual for American presidential candidates to meet with British leaders during the campaign; President Barack  did so when he took a trip abroad as the likely Democratic nominee in 2008. Romney's weeklong trip also will take him to Israel and Poland. On Thursday, Romney also met with former Prime Minister Tony Blair; Ed Miliband, the current leader of the Labour Party — the opposition to Cameron's Conservative Party; and Foreign Secretary William Hague. The candidate also met with Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, Britain's top financial official. On Friday, Romney is scheduled to attend the opening ceremonies of the London Games. This wasn't Romney's first meeting with Cameron; the two talked when Romney visited London in 2011. Cameron visited the U.S. earlier this year to meet with Obama and attended a White House state dinner, but he did not meet with Romney. The meetings come a day after the Daily Telegraph published a story quoting an unidentified Romney campaign adviser saying the Republican believes the U.S. relationship with Britain is special because of shared ""Anglo-Saxon heritage"" that the adviser said the White House doesn't appreciate. Romney, however, quickly distanced himself from any such view. ""I don't agree with whoever that adviser might be,"" Romney told NBC News, ""but do agree that we have a very common bond between ourselves and Great Britain."" Nonetheless, Vice President Joe Biden and top Obama aides criticized Romney. ""The comments reported this morning are a disturbing start to a trip designed to demonstrate Gov. Romney's readiness to represent the United States on the world's stage,"" Biden said. Accompanying Romney to some of his meetings Thursday were former Missouri Sen. Jim Talent, an adviser, and Kerry Healey, who served as lieutenant governor when Romney was governor of Massachusetts. Three of Romney's sons — Tagg, Josh and Craig — also have joined him in London."
2012-08-20,"Media Companies, Seeing Profit Slip, Push Into Education",0.10101629935720846,"As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”"
2012-08-30,What’s the Risk for Investors of Turkey Going Islamist ? ,0.13601598173515983,"Turkey is as complex as a Byzantine mosaic or a potent Turkish coffee. Straddling Europe, Asia and the Middle East, it’s a Muslim country with ancient Christian roots — but founded as a modern nation in 1923 by a militant secularist, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. For decades an economic backwater, it’s now the fastest-growing economy in Europe.That economic success was achieved by an Islamist-leaning government that has managed successfully to meld the conservative religious devotion of the masses with the economic interests of the secular elite.But what if Turkey, propelled by its majority of populist conservative Muslims, were to adopt a more extreme version of Islam? Syria, its neighbor to the south, is disintegrating — abetted according to some reports by rebels connected to Al Qaeda. Some of those rebels may be drifting across the border into Turkey. And there are rumors that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has intestinal cancer; with no clear successor to his decade-old leadership, his ruling Justice and Development (AKP) party could splinter and give rise to a more extremist Islamic rule. (Read More: Slideshow: Investing in Turkish Art)Yet experts say Turkey is so much improved economically from a decade ago that there is little chance its people would risk that prosperity — and relations with the West — to adopt an extremist Islamic state.That is not to say, however, that Turkey isn’t dealing with a precarious religious situation. “The society is going more conservative,” said Ebru Erdem, political science professor at the University of California at Riverside. “It’s been going on since the 1990s, and that is still in progress.” Erdem said Turks who don’t fast during the holy month of Ramadan, for instance, or who drink alcohol, face ostracism. And last spring the AKP ignited a debate about the morality of abortion and C-sections, two issues Erdem said had never before caused so much as a flicker on the Turkish radar screen. “They are not like the Islamist parties of before,” Erdem said. “They come from the same traditions, but they said they have taken off that shirt and they present themselves as a ‘liberal’ political party.” Erdem and other Turkey experts liken the religious dynamic in Turkey to none other than the U.S., comparing the AKP to the most conservative Christians of the Republican Party. “They are modeling on the Americans,” Erdem said. For instance, she said, the government has gradually begun regulating alcohol sales. “They say it’s not good for you, and they give the example of the U.S. Bible Belt, where you can’t buy alcohol on Sundays.” Brian Mello, a Turkey expert who teaches political science at Muhlenberg College in Pennsylvania, said “political Islam is really popular, especially in Istanbul. You’ll see a lot of women wearing a headscarf, and if you look at the popular support for the ruling party, they’ve done nothing but increase their support.” He said “the real fear” is that Turkey is home to “various Islamic movements that have sought to reclaim the capacity to engage in religion in the public square. ... That could be a slippery slope to an Iranian-style Islamic regime.”  The emphasis is on the word “could,” however. According to Mello, “if you look at the U.S. now, and look at all the anti-abortion laws passed in state legislatures, and if you’re a secularist, then you might become afraid about the role of religion in American politics. If those fears are legitimate in the U.S., they’re legitimate in Turkey, too.” But Mello added: “The way religion affects the Republican Party in the United States is stronger than the way it affects (the ruling AKP) in Turkey.” Which is to say — interesting, worrying if you happen to be a secularist — but likely unimportant when it comes to the economy. (Read more:Investing in Europe’s Fastest-Growing Economy)Andrew Birch, senior economist for Europe for IHS, agrees. “When you look at the Justice and Development Party, there are a lot of concerns from the West, including the party’s lack of democracy. But from an economic point of view, they’ve been good stewards of the economy.” The biggest recent concern about Turkey’s Muslim bent was that its banks would adopt Islamic-style banking. (.) But that hasn’t happened — in fact, most of the country’s biggest banks operate exactly like Western ones. A more immediate concern is that Turkey’s economy has begun to slow, Birch said. Last year the economy grew at an 8.5 percent pace, but in the first half of 2012, its growth was below 3 percent. “If there are economic hardships, that’s going to give a boost to Islam because the fundamentalist movement is being drawn from poorer, disenfranchised areas,” Birch said. “But I’m not worried about them cycling back. As long as Istanbul stays important — that’s where the secular business people reside and hold a strong grasp — I wouldn’t be worried that much about an influx of conservative ideology going into the business sector.”  Erdem says the ruling party would probably like to enforce a more conservative Islamic society — but can’t afford to. “The current success is dependent on incoming foreign flows,” she said. “Especially with the financial crisis in Europe, a lot of hot money has come to Turkey because Turkey is stable. “Even if they wanted to [enforce a change] for an ideological reason, they couldn’t risk it,” Erdem said. “They owe their electoral success to economic security.”"
2012-08-30,Colombian Oil: Is It Time To Invest?,0.13932536886025265,"Investors—Canadian ones, in particular—may recall Colombia as one of the hottest oil plays in the world. That was just a few years ago. Huge wells in these plays created huge valuations—and some strong runs for stocks like Pacific Rubiales and Petrominerales.Today of course is a different story, with stock prices having fallen off the map—despite favorable oil prices. So what happened that caused these sharp share price drops? And are there good reasons for investors to turn back again to Colombia's oil plays? We asked Fred Kozak for his insights—He's an independent oil and gas analyst, formerly with the Canadian brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity. “Colombia still has FARC issues, environmental permitting is still a big problem and pipeline constraints are all impacting the investment climate,” he said in an interview. FARC is the Spanish acronym for the left wing guerrilla movement in Colombia. Former President Alvaro Uribe was able to secure billions of dollars in US aid in the last decade, which was used for the military and other means to reduce the FARC’s impact on the country. [ More From Oilprice.com: Why It's Time to Invest in Iran's Renewable Energy ]With the FARC risk down considerably, foreign investors felt secure in investing billions of private capital into the country’s energy sector—especially the upstream oil and gas producers. The Canadians were quite active then, led by companies like Frank Giustra’s and Serafino Iacono’s Pacific Rubiales and John Wright’s and Corey Ruttan’s Petrominerales. Both companies had great success developing assets in the Llanos Basin in the middle of the country, and both had exceptional stock runs. PRE skyrocketed from $2-$34 in 2009-2010, and PMG rose from $6-$40. A Perfect Storm of Oil Exploration It all happened at the same time: There was a perfect storm of exploration success, a lower royalty rate, and the sense that this under-explored country could continue its string of high profile discoveries for years. Promoters created new junior exploration companies with bloated share counts—hundreds of millions of shares out—and investors jumped all over these opportunities. These days? In what I would refer to as the senior Colombian stocks—Rubiales, Gran Tierra—they’re just above 50 percent of their highs, and the rest are anywhere from 20-50 percent of their highs. That second round of bloated share-count juniors quickly lost 80 percent of their value, and have only recently popped their head up. Did anybody get the license plate on the truck that ran over these stocks? It was actually several trucks, says Kozak. He says one of the big factors hitting these stocks was the Arab Spring of 2011—all international juniors the world over sold off after institutional and retail investors lost their appetite for foreign risk, as dictators got toppled one after the other starting in early 2011. And sadly for everyone, FARC violence has increased this year. After several years of declining activity, brokerage firm Raymond James reports in an Aug. 13 report that there has been a “material” increase of security incidents reported since the beginning of the year. Pipeline attacks increased three-fold year-over-year, and five Ecopetrol contractors were killed in Putumayo this summer, near the Colombian/Ecuador/Peru border. FARC pipeline attacks don't help an already difficult situation—increased oil production in Colombia has strained pipeline capacity. “As much as 100,000 barrels a day of oil production (bopd) could be shut in, I'm not exactly sure, but it means that you have to truck oil,” says Kozak. This means higher transportation costs, and companies can’t produce new discoveries at full throttle. In a negative market, that's deadly to a company’s share price. Colombia’s daily oil production currently exceeds 900,000 bopd, having risen more than 60 percent since 2006, but pipeline constraints have not allowed it to crack the magic 1 million bopd mark. Barriers to Progress Producers in Colombia are also experiencing long delays in permitting. Wells are not being drilled as fast as before, with companies being left waiting for up to a year without knowing when they’ll be able to drill. That has hurt exploration activities, and several of the leading Colombian juniors are now spending a big chunk of their exploration in Brazil, Ecuador and Peru—and sometimes even farther afield. Another factor, Kozak adds, is that the new discoveries in Colombia just aren’t coming as quickly as they did a couple years ago. “Colombia had great success at one point—but today look at Petrominerales and GranTierra Energy. PMG is now struggling while GTE is focused on developing discoveries. New discoveries are still limited,"" he said.[ More From Oilprice.com: GM Temporarily Halts Volt Production Over Low Sales ]Colombia reported that 34 percent of all wells were successful in the first half of 2012, compared with a 48 percent average from 2008-2010. Canadians formed a big portion of the foreigners who entered into the Colombian oil and gas sector in 2008-2009. I asked Kozak why that was, and he answered: “We in Canada are entrepreneurs. We have so many teams chasing so many opportunities, and recent success with our 'resource plays' here has been technology-related. Then guys say, hey, we can apply that somewhere else. We go apply our best practices and use our technology and turn things around.” The Canadians focused on the Llanos Basin, which looks geologically a lot like Alberta’s foothills (light oil) and the Putamayo in the south which is similar to Alberta’s plains (heavy oil). Colombia is one of a few countries in South America where you could go into the country and do business a lot like you would do in the west. The country is out of favor right now but Fred believes the question is when do you invest in the country, not if. “With $100 Brent oil, you have $60-$70 netbacks—you can make phenomenal money in that country, but there are short term issues"" Kozak said, adding that those short-term issues reflect growing pains, as the oil and gas sector continues to mature.“Success is responsible for the delays we’re seeing now—Colombia redefined its fiscal regime to attract new investment and kicked FARC out of most of country since President Uribe started his second term in 2006,"" he said.Recently, the army has increased its size and activity in the oil-producing regions, improving security. That may lead to an improved perception regarding security in 3-6 months. Permitting times have been slowly improving—the government is adding more people here as well. That should allow several companies to carry their plans of drilling high impact wells in the second half of 2012. Catalysts for Colombia's Junior Oil Companies A new pipeline starting in the first quarter of 2013 is expected to carry more than 490,000 bopd. As that new capacity becomes imminent, it could be a huge catalyst for Colombian juniors. An intriguing potential catalyst will happen sooner, however. The government has a new bid round in October for 115 blocks including 1/3rd for shale exploration in the Magdalena Basin. Says Kozak: “There have been a number of wells drilled that have seen shale but nothing like western Canada. Remember that the drilling density in this part of Colombia is a fraction of what North America is used to. Both Exxon and Shell are scheduled to drill a well each on Canacol farm-in lands, but depending on the bid round results in October, those results are not likely to be a 2012 catalyst.” Kozak concludes that addressing the country-specific risks will help (FARC, permitting delays, pipeline constraints) but the tide that would lift all boats requires the risk on trade to come back. But he says investors should not sit on their hands waiting for the tide to come in: “There’s going to be opportunity there especially through mergers & acquisition. These companies are very cheap. At these levels it’s almost cheaper to buy than to drill. The acquisition of PetroMagdalena by Pacific Rubiales being an example.” So how should investors approach investing in Colombian juniors?  “Remember it’s always about the people. When looking at companies to invest in, who are the people involved—and projects—how quickly can they take it to production,"" Kozak said.By Keith Schaefer —This story originally appeared on Oilprice.com.

Sixty-nine of the 574 had negative cash flow for both of the past two quarters."

2012-10-02,EMerge Alliance Releases Version 1.1 of Occupied Space Standard,0.15263798701298706,"Progress continues toward integrated standards for DC microgrids in      buildings         SAN RAMON, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--      The      EMerge Alliance – an open industry association leading the rapid      adoption of safe direct-current (DC) power distribution standards for      commercial buildings – today announced it has updated the EMerge      Alliance Occupied Space standard, the first application platform model      for the utilization of low-voltage DC power in commercial interiors.           The EMerge Alliance Occupied Space standard creates an integrated, open      platform for power, interior infrastructures, controls and a wide      variety of peripheral devices to facilitate the hybrid use of AC and DC      power within commercial buildings. Version 1.1 includes several      important updates to voltage limits, recommended cable sizes and other      requirements to assist companies developing products when using the      standard. These changes are backwards compatible and maximize the      interoperability and efficiency of EMerge Alliance Registered products.           According to Alliance Chairman Brian Patterson, the Occupied Space      standard version 1.1 allows for better connectivity with the forthcoming      EMerge Alliance Task Level/Furnishings standard and contributes to the      organization’s push to deliver a portfolio of integrated standards that      increase building flexibility and sustainability, while lowering      operating costs. These standards also facilitate the direct use of      on-site power generation and storage, which eliminates the need for many      inefficient power form conversions in buildings.           “The standards we’re creating for DC microgrids are the keys to      unlocking unprecedented efficiency, flexibility and sustainability in      buildings,” said Patterson. “The latest advancements in the EMerge      Alliance Occupied Space standard demonstrate that the Alliance is      committed to driving the continued development and expansion of      standards that will deliver DC power throughout buildings.”           The EMerge Alliance Occupied Space standard has been well received by      both product manufacturers and the early adopters of the building      community. There are more than 50 EMerge Alliance Registered products      available for use today, representing everything needed to implement the      platform. The EMerge Alliance Occupied Space standard version 1.1 is      available exclusively to Governing, Participating and General Members of      the Alliance, and a free public overview is available at http://www.emergealliance.org/Standard/RequestStandard.aspx.      To join the Alliance, please visit http://emergealliance.org/Join/HowtoJoin.aspx.      The EMerge Alliance’s Growing Standards Portfolio        The EMerge Alliance continues to work toward completing new DC power      standards to achieve net-zero energy buildings. The soon-to-be-released      Data/Telecom Center standard will provide a practical guide for the      hybrid use of DC power in data centers, offering better efficiency, a      smaller footprint, improved reliability and lower capital and      installation costs. Currently in development, the Campus Microgrid      standard will focus on establishing a standard for the integration of DC      microgrids throughout whole buildings. Also in progress, the Task      Level/Furnishings standard connects DC power to desktop technologies and      applications. Moving forward, the Alliance will continue its vision by      developing future standards for building services, such as HVAC, and      outdoor applications, such as electric vehicle charging. All EMerge      Alliance standards include consideration of power, infrastructure,      peripheral device and control applications required to operate a      building application platform using DC power.      About the EMerge Alliance        The EMerge Alliance is an open industry association leading the rapid      adoption of safe DC power distribution in commercial buildings through      the development of EMerge Alliance standards. These innovative standards      integrate interior infrastructures, power, controls and devices in      common microgrid platforms to facilitate the hybrid use of AC and DC      power throughout buildings for unprecedented design and space      flexibility, greater energy efficiency and improved sustainability. The      nonprofit Alliance is accepting new members at various levels. For more      information, please visit www.EMergeAlliance.org."
2012-10-02,Healthcare Market Success: Cave Consulting Group (CCGroup) Affirms Continued Downloads of Free CaveGrouper-Lite™,0.1153679653679654,"SAN MATEO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--      CCGroup announced in April 2012 the release of a free download      version of the Cave      Grouper™ software known as CaveGrouper-Lite™. This is the      first public grouper of medical condition episodes-of-care.      CaveGrouper-Lite™ builds longitudinal episodes of care for acute      conditions (e.g., upper respiratory infections, sinusitis) and for      chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, asthma).           The Cave Grouper™ is the oldest and most established grouper of      episodes-of-care in the market today. The first article was published in      1992 based on work formed since 1989. Over the past 22 years,      derivations of the Cave Grouper™ have been applied and validated using a      wide variety of study populations totaling over 90 million individuals      and 705,000 physicians. CCGroup has invested significant time and effort      to determine and develop the most appropriate methods to build      episodes-of-care and to obtain reliable, stable provider efficiency      scores, especially the method on using a predefined set of medical      conditions for a specialty type.      “CCGroup is proud to be the first company to release a free      grouper of medical condition episodes to the public,” stated Dr.      Douglas G. Cave, President of CCGroup. “This is a key phase to allow      all of CCGroup’s methods and algorithms to be 100% transparent for      public use – including health plans, health systems, and the Federal and      State governments.”           CaveGrouper-Lite™ has been successfully downloaded a significant number      of times – and the downloads continue. Dr.      John Rootenberg, SVP of Clinical Strategy, affirmed the following      percentage breakdown by entity type. “20% of downloads were from health      plans; 16% from healthcare consulting firms; 15% from physician groups;      14% from hospital-based health systems; 14% from academic universities      and research organizations; 9% from healthcare software vendors; 4% for      State and Federal Government agencies (such as the Centers for Medicare      and Medicaid Services); 4% from pharmaceutical/biotech companies; 2%      from potential competitors to CCGroup; and 2% from all other.”           A main reason stated for downloading CaveGrouper-Lite™ continues to be      the new Accountable Care Organization (ACO) and Patient      Centered Medical Home (PCMH) legislation. “The      CaveGrouper-Lite™ is essential for consistent episode-of-care analytics      and performance measurement,” stated Dr. Cave. “For resource      planning purposes, clinical leaders need to gain a complete view of the      medical condition prevalence of their covered population base. In this      manner, healthcare resource needs may be adjusted with changes in the      condition-specific prevalence rates.”           Other common reasons stated for downloading CaveGrouper-Lite™ included      the following. Clinical leaders stated they need to track medical      condition episodes-of-care to physicians and compare their average costs      and utilization patterns to one another and to CCGroup’s national      comparative database. Also, under the CMS Bundled Payments initiative,      the episodes-of-care may be used by clinical leaders to examine possible      bundled payment models.           Dr. Cave stated, “A key foundation for accountable performance      measurement is the CaveGrouper-Lite™ because the methods and algorithms      are 100% transparent, free to the public, and tested and validated on      all study populations.”      Download      the CaveGrouper-Lite™   About Cave Consulting Group, Inc.

Edition No. 2"" to their      offering.           Aquacultural, oceanographic, and fisheries engineering, as well as other      disciplines, require gas solubility data to compute the equilibrium      concentration. These calculations, for example, can affect the output of      aquacultural production or assist in environmental consulting.           Until now, published solubility information has not been available in a      consistent and uniform manner in one location. This book presents      solubility concentrations of major atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen,      argon, carbon dioxide), noble gases (helium, neon, krypton, xenon), and      trace gases (hydrogen, methane, nitrous oxide) as a function of      temperature, salinity, pressure, and gas composition in a variety of      formats.           Data, equations, and theory are explained so that the user is able to      understand the calculations and problems. Furthermore, data and      solubility information are presented in a range of units to make them      accessible across disciplines.           This book will help the reader to look at a problem from a quantitative      viewpoint and better understand carbonate chemistry. Revised from the      earlier edition to include more accurate carbon dioxide tables and      separate sections on the solubility of noble gases, trace gases, and      oxygen in brines to provide a single resource for gas solubility data.

2012-10-03,"A.M. Best Assigns Rating to WellPoint, Inc.’s New Senior Convertible Debentures",0.3515936147186147,"OLDWICK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--      A.M. Best Co. has assigned a debt rating of “bbb+” to the $1.35      billion 2.75% senior convertible debentures due 2042 recently issued by WellPoint,      Inc. (WellPoint) (Indianapolis, IN) [NYSE: WLP]. The rating has been      placed under review with negative implications, which is consistent with      the under review status of the existing ratings of WellPoint and its      insurance subsidiaries. (See A.M. Best’s press release dated July 10,      2012 for further information.)           The securities are being sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant      to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. If the initial purchasers      exercise their over-allotment option in full, the net proceeds from the      offering would approach $1.5 billion. WellPoint intends to use up to      $400 million of the net proceeds for common share repurchase and the      remainder for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to      additional share repurchase and debt repayment.           Although WellPoint’s pro forma financial leverage—as well as its      goodwill and intangibles to equity ratio—is somewhat higher than      similarly-rated peers, A.M. Best views somewhat favorably the financial      flexibility afforded by the convertible debentures. Additionally, the      issuance is consistent with A.M. Best’s expectations with respect to      WellPoint’s capital structure incorporating the financing for the      previously announced $5.0 billion (approximate) acquisition of AMERIGROUP      Corporation (Amerigroup).           The Amerigroup acquisition is expected to close by year-end 2012,      subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. WellPoint’s ratings      are anticipated to remain under review pending the completion of the      transaction and A.M. Best’s continuing discussions with management.      However, A.M. Best will continue to monitor WellPoint’s operating      performance, risk-based capitalization at the operating companies and      its capital structure to ensure financial and operating metrics remain      within A.M. Best’s expectations.           The methodology used in determining these ratings is Best’s Credit      Rating Methodology, which provides a comprehensive explanation of A.M.      Best’s rating process and contains the different rating criteria      employed in the rating process. Best’s Credit Rating Methodology can be      found at www.ambest.com/ratings/methodology.

2012-10-08,Euro zone to launch bailout fund with Spain in focus,0.048507777533201256,"By Jan Strupczewski   BRUSSELS, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers willlaunch their 500 billion euro ($653.00 billion) permanentbailout fund on Monday, putting in place a major defence againstthe debt crisis that now threatens Spain.   The fund, called the European Stability Mechanism (ESM),will be used to lend to distressed euro zone sovereigns inreturn for strict fiscal and structural reforms that aim to puteconomies that have lost investor trust back on track.   It is part of the single currency area's drive for anoverhaul of its economic structures and deeper integration, adiscussion that will be taken forward on Monday with talks on anidea to create a single euro-zone budget.   Euro zone finance ministers, who form the ESM's board ofgovernors, will hold their inaugural meeting in Luxembourg twoyears after EU leaders endorsed the idea of setting up such apermanent institution.   ""The ESM will be operational as of Monday,"" said a euro zoneofficial, linked to the ESM.   The fund's lending capacity will be based on 80 billioneuros of paid-in capital and 620 billion of callable capital,against which the ESM will borrow money on the market to lend iton to governments cut off from sustainable market funding.   It will reach its full capacity gradually by 2014.   Its first task will be to lend to Spain for therecapitalisation of its banking sector, hit hard by a collapseof the real estate market - a programme inherited from thetemporary European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).   Madrid is likely to ask for about 40 billion euros torecapitalise its banks following independent assessments of thesectors' needs -- well within the 100 billion euros set aside byeuro zone finance ministers for the purpose in July.   The ESM money would flow to Spain in November, afterEuropean Commission competition authorities approve conditionsfor the recapitalisation for each bank.   SPAIN IN FOCUS   Spain is in investors' focus because it has struggled to cutone of the euro zone's largest public deficits as the countrysinks deeper into its second recession in three years.   In Luxembourg, euro zone ministers will also discuss arequest, expected from Spain sometime in the coming weeks, for aprecautionary credit line from the ESM that they hope will boostinvestor confidence and keep Madrid in the capital markets.   A euro zone source said they may also discuss Spain's tough2013 budget, outlined last month, which the InternationalMonetary Fund and the European Commission both believe is basedon an over-optimistic forecast of a 0.5 percent economiccontraction next year. The current IMF forecast of a 1.2 percentrecession may be revised further downwards on Tuesday.   A revised budget based on updated IMF and EU forecasts maybe one condition for assistance from the ESM.   Such a programme would likely entail the issuance offirst-loss guarantees on bonds sold by Spain at auction, or somesimilar form of rescue to bolster Madrid's credibility.   Guaranteeing the first 20-30 percent loss on new Spanishbonds would allow - through leveraging - all of Spain's 207billion debt issuance in 2013 to be made much more attractive toinvestors using roughly 50 billion euros of euro zone money.   Such an amount would fit comfortably within the 100 billionlimit already approved by parliaments for the bank rescue incountries with strong anti-bailout sentiment like Germany andFinland, making it politically more palatable, even iftechnically it would remain a separate operation.   A credit line for Spain would also open the way forpurchases of Spanish bonds on the secondary market by theEuropean Central Bank -- a prospect that has lowered Spanishyields already from above 7 percent in July to below 5.72 now.   But Germany opposes a Spanish bailout request now, becauseit would prefer to bundle Spain with a request for a small, 15billion euro bailout for Cyprus and a revision of the second,130 billion euro bailout for Greece in one crisis-solvingpackage later this year.   This would allow German Chancellor Angela Merkel, wary ofshaky support for bailouts in her own ruling coalition, to pushthe large crisis package through parliament in one go, ratherthan fight separate battles for each.   As a result, a Spanish request is unlikely for a few weeks.   The ministers will also take stock of the efforts of Greeceto unblock payments from the second bailout agreed in Februaryafter reforms in the debt-laden country stalled because of twogeneral elections in May and June.   Inspectors representing international lenders are in talkswith the Greek government on reforms and austerity needed tounlock financial aid, but their full report is unlikely beforethe end of October.   EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn saidon Saturday he expected Greece's government to agree on neededsavings in the coming days since the lengthy talks between thetroubled euro country and lenders had advanced.($1 = 0.7657 euros)(Additional reporting by Julien Toyer in Madrid; Editing byPaul Taylor)((jan.strupczewski@thomsonreuters.com)(+32 2 287 68 37)(ReutersMessaging: jan.strupczewski.reuters.com@reuters.net))Keywords: EUROGROUP/"

2012-10-08,New TalentBin Interest Scores to Provide Recruiters with a Quick Measure of the Intensity of a Candidates' Professional Interests,0.17637707120465737,"SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 8, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- TalentBin, the talent search engine that turbo-charges talent discovery across the web, today announced the launch of TalentBin Scores, a new addition to the company's flagship social recruiting solution, providing a relative weight for how intensely candidates exhibit a given professional interest or skill across the web. TalentBin Scores will be unveiled in Booth #955 at the 2012 HR Technology Conference and Exposition, where the company will also be showcased as one of the most innovative software solutions that promise to enhance and improve the HR function in the ""Awesome New Technologies for HR"" session presented by HR technology guru Bill Kutik. Since its launch this spring, TalentBin has quickly demonstrated its strength at filling in information gaps for recruiters and hiring managers by scouring the web for clues left by candidates on social media sites and online professional communities – delivering a more complete and well-rounded web resume. Unlike online profiles or traditional resumes that lack an expressed measure of depth in a particular professional interest, TalentBin Scores provide an indicator of intensity of a given professional interest, to better help recruiters and hiring managers quickly assess if a candidate could be the right fit – significantly streamlining the filtering process. With the addition of TalentBin Scores, the company is going deeper into the candidate profile, to not only tell prospective employers what a candidate knows, but the intensity with which they demonstrate that know how. Drawn from observable online activity, these indicator levels can not only help recruiters see the relative intensities of a candidate's various professional interests, but also help them compare the intensities of the same interests between multiple candidates. Ultimately, TalentBin Scores are designed to enable employers to more quickly and efficiently zero in on candidates most likely to fit their specific skills requirements for their open positions.""As part of the TalentBin process of interpreting online professional activity to identify the skills that would be relevant to an employer, we naturally discovered that the skills and interests we found were not all at equal strength,"" explained Peter Kazanjy, co-founder of TalentBin. ""When a recruiter is scanning LinkedIn or other professional profiles, they are lucky to get all the skills they are looking for listed – no less a scale of how deeply a candidate may be involved with a given skill or interest. TalentBin Score was created to solve that problem, providing a quick measure of the strength of those interests.""Currently, more than 100 leading companies, including Facebook, Groupon, Dolby, and Yahoo!, rely on TalentBin for their online sourcing and social recruiting needs. TalentBin aggregates a candidate's ""implicit"" professional activity from the skills and interests they reveal across social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Meetup, Quora, and more, coupled with activity on other industry-specific social communities like GitHub, SourceForge, and Bitbucket for software engineering, for example. This additional information bolsters passive professional profiles with input that is vital to helping recruiters determine ideal job fit. The result is a more accurate, 360-degree view of a candidate that covers everything from professional skills to personal interests, information that does not usually appear on resumes or online professional profiles. TalentBin then takes it one step further, compiling all contact information such as email addresses, Twitter handles, and more to help facilitate direct candidate engagement.TalentBin offers an API for seamless integrations with a wide range of software partners. The TalentBin solution already has over 200 million candidate profiles cultivated from the US Patent Database and over 30 professional social media communities, and growing. To make TalentBin a part of your talent sourcing and acquisition strategy, visit www.talentbin.com.About TalentBinBased in San Francisco, TalentBin is focused on turbo-charging talent acquisition for recruiters and hiring managers with its talent search engine, turning the web into a virtually endless talent sourcing database.

2012-10-09,UPDATE 2-Serb central bank raises key rate to 10.75 pct,-0.005533459595959594,"* Rate rise of 25 basis points tied to inflation, retailprices hike   * Future policy moves hinge on inflation, fiscalconsolidation(Updates with IMF report, background)   By Aleksandar Vasovic   BELGRADE, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Serbia's central bank raised itsbenchmark interest, already the region's highest, by 25 basispoints to 10.75 percent on Tuesday, reflecting rising inflationand debt concerns.   Other central banks in Central and Eastern Europe have cutrates over the past two weeks, as growth slows across theregion, although Poland bucked the trend last week by keepingrates flat due to concerns over inflation.   Serbia stands out as an exception because of a cocktail ofrising inflation and debt and an economy sliding into recessionamidst crisis in the euro-zone, its main trading partner.   ""Considering that the increase of food prices andstate-controlled prices is higher than expected and thatinflationary expectations are on the rise, the Executive Boardhas decided to increase the benchmark rate  toprevent the spillover... to other prices,"" the Serbian bank saidin a statement.   Serbian inflation in August rose to 7.9 percent, up from 6.1percent in July, due to a poor harvest and the government's bidto finance its 2012 budget gap amounting to 6.2 percent of GDPthrough a rise in value-added tax.   The central bank estimates that inflation should continue torise until mid-2013 and then slide back to its target band offour percent, give or take 1.5 percentage points, the same asfor 2012. However, some analysts voiced caution.    ""That inflation is not driven by demand ... in that sense,the monetary policy is powerless,"" said Miladin Kovacevic, ananalyst with the Belgarde-based Economics Institute.    Djordje Djukic, a lecturer of economics with BelgradeUniversity, said Tuesday's rate hike was beneficial forportfolio investors, ""who will make profits on short-termmaturities, but bad for budget and debt"".   ""The effects (of the rate hike) on inflation are veryuncertain as the Serbian economy is highly monopolised andplagued by high production costs, low productivity andcompetitiveness,"" Djukic said.   RISING DEBT   The deficit, inflation and rising social discontent haveprompted the coalition government of nationalists andSocialists, which came to power in July, to borrow more. Thatincluded a Sept. 27 issue of a $1 billion Eurobond and a $1billion loan from Russia, planned for this year and next.   Serbia's total public debt this year is expected to reach 60percent of GDP and the country wants a new stand-by loan dealwith the International Monetary Fund to reassure investors.   The Fund froze a 1-billion euro ($1.30 billion) loan dealwith Belgrade in February over inflated spending and debt andtold Serbia last month to restore the autonomy of the centralbank and rein in spending before any new loan talks.   In its October World Economic Outlook, the lender saidSerbia's economy was expected to contract by 0.5 percent thisyear and grow 2 percent in 2013.   In the statement, the central bank said its future policymoves would depend on inflationary expectations, externalinfluences and the effects of fiscal consolidation.   The dinar  rallied versus the European commoncurrency last month after domestic banks started issuinggovernment-subsidised loans to aid exporters hit by the crisisin the euro zone, Serbia's main trade partner.  The dinar has been trading at an average of 115 dinars to oneeuro since, as opposed to an average 117.5 in the days beforeits recovery. By midday on Tuesday, following the rateannouncement, it firmed against the euro and was trading atbetween 114.56 and 114.76 to one euro.

2012-10-11,Romney seeks more assertive US policy on China,0.03881523569023569,"WASHINGTON -- Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney is promising to get tough on China to help American workers, but his plans could backfire.Romney is pledging, on his first day in office, to designate China a currency manipulator, a step no administration has taken against any country for 18 years.That could, eventually, lead to tariffs punishing China for policies that Americans believe unfairly keep Chinese products cheap, hurting U.S. manufacturers. Tariffs could trigger a trade war with a country that is the fastest-growing market for U.S. exports. Even if they don't, the designation would instantly set back relations with Asia's emerging superpower.The U.S. seeks Chinese cooperation on international hot spots, such as North Korea and Iran, and wants to narrow differences over how to handle maritime territorial disputes in East Asia.Given the potential repercussions, some foreign policy experts doubt Romney would carry out the currency threat. Other presidential candidates have made similar promises in order to appeal to voters who have seen manufacturing jobs migrate to China. But, once elected, they soften their approach.""There's probably been wisdom in administrations in the past, Republican and Democrat, of not wanting to go there,"" said Jon Huntsman, who served as President Barack Obama's first ambassador to China before a failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination.But the commitment to act on Inauguration Day doesn't appear to leave much room to back down.Romney has also taken aim at Obama's ""pivot"" to Asia _ a strategy of deploying more forces and shoring up U.S. alliances there, in part to counter China's military buildup.In a speech this week, Romney said China's recent assertiveness was ""sending chills through the region."" He said the pivot is under-resourced and has alienated U.S. allies elsewhere. He outlined plans to expand U.S. naval power _ although it's unclear how he'd pay for it since he also wants to slash government spending.""What we have seen from the Obama administration has been acquiescence to China, not just on trade issues and currency issues, but on issues of security and human rights,"" said Romney foreign policy adviser Alex Wong. ""To protect our interests and those of our small businesses and of our economy, we have to take measures to make sure China does play by the rules.""U.S.-Chinese relations are entering a critical juncture. Two days after the Nov. 6 vote, China will begin its own once-in-a-decade leadership transition. How the next U.S. administration gets on with the new guard in Beijing could determine whether the world's pre-eminent military powers can cooperate in the Asia-Pacific region or head on a path to confrontation.Appreciation of those stakes tends to get lost in the fiercely fought election campaign.Both Romney and Obama have TV spots with China as a foil. Romney accuses Obama of being soft on China's trade practices; Obama accuses Romney of outsourcing U.S. jobs to China when he ran the private equity firm Bain Capital.The tone of the debate, labeling China a ""cheat,"" has drawn withering criticism from the architect of U.S. re-engagement with Beijing 40 years ago, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who has nonetheless endorsed Romney. Kissinger said that avoiding conflict between the powers is the most fundamental challenge for U.S. foreign policy.China's state media has weighed in with unusually direct criticism of a presidential candidate, suggesting that Beijing hopes Obama will win.News agency Xinhua has accused Romney of hypocrisy, saying much of his wealth was made doing business with Chinese companies and warning that his ""mudslinging"" policies could spark a trade war.Early in his presidency, Obama made warmer relations with China a priority, and ties have deepened. The two governments have navigated some rough patches _ such as the standoff over a blind activist, Chen Guangcheng, who sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and was then allowed to come to the U.S. to study. The Obama administration said that reflected a maturing relationship.But diplomacy has failed to bridge fundamental differences on issues such as climate change, the civil war in Syria and China's territorial disputes with its neighbors. And as the U.S. has wound down its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, its modest moves to deploy more forces around Asia have irritated Beijing.Romney is calling for an even stronger U.S. presence in the Pacific. Wong said that would encourage the peaceful resolution of the region's many maritime territorial disputes, including one flaring between U.S. ally Japan and China over islands both claim. He said Romney would make clear it has a treaty alliance with Japan that covers the islands and has the naval power to back it up.Those plans, though, could take years to implement. Addressing the currency issue on Day One would immediately affect relations.Romney says he would designate China as a manipulator unless it stops currency manipulation by his January inauguration. Romney trade policy adviser Oren Cass said this would set a new tone and show the U.S. is willing to take China to task over a range of trade violations, including intellectual property theft and restrictions on market access for U.S. companies in China.The designation itself would not mandate any sanctions, but would require that the U.S. hold consultations with China.Cass said that if Beijing doesn't move toward changing its currency policies after consultations, the U.S. could impose so-called countervailing duties on Chinese products.But Matthew Goodman, former director of international economics in the National Security Council under Obama, said the U.S. discretion to unilaterally impose retaliatory tariffs ended when it joined the World Trade Organization in 1995, and in practice it is difficult to take a currency dispute to the WTO for settlement. Cass says that under domestic law, the U.S. could impose countervailing duties, and it's an open legal question at the WTO whether member states can do so unilaterally to compensate for a currency subsidy.How China would respond may be swayed by its leadership transition. The new guard would not want to appear weak. But neither would China want the dispute to escalate as it relies on exports and faces its own economic slowdown. If that translates into major job losses at home it could affect social stability, which is Beijing's biggest concern.Obama has consistently opted against designation of China as a currency manipulator. Like President George W. Bush before him, he has preferred to wait while economic forces encourage Beijing to allow its currency to strengthen _ which it has done, although most economists still believe it is undervalued.The Treasury is due to make its next six-month assessment on Monday, although it's not yet clear if it will be announced on that date. China is likely to get a pass."

2012-10-19,What an Earthquake Can Teach You About Problem Solving,-0.021519886363636345,"On a 1-10 scale: how do you respond to problems? Try this technique. Whenever there's an earthquake——the first thing you wonder is, ""How bad was it on the Richter scale?"" I'm a big fan of the Richter scale, even though I don't really understand it. The scale goes from 1-10, but the smallest earthquake ""that can be felt"" (Webster's), only gets a 2. If I were in an earthquake that could be felt and it only got a 2, I'd be extremely disappointed.  ""Obviously,"" I'd say, ""whoever gave this thing a 2 is nowhere near the epicenter."" (I'd definitely say the word ""epicenter"" to indicate that I know a thing or two about earthquakes.) But most earthquakes aren't 10's. This week's tremor was a 4.0. Our house shook for 10 seconds, then nothing. Most problems aren't 10's either. That's why we ought to use a 1-10 scale for everything. Let's say you're stuck in traffic on the way to work. It may feel like a big deal at the time, but it probably isn't. In terms of problems, traffic is a 1. The rational part of our brain knows that. The rational part is like a calm seismologist, unimpressed by most emotional tremors. We need to cultivate this part. Stuck in a long meeting? ""WHEN WILL THIS END?"" you want to shout. ""Hold on a minute,"" the calm seismologist says, ""There are only a few thousand PowerPoint slides left. Therefore, we should be out of here, at the very latest, by next Wednesday. On a 1-10 scale, this meeting is a 1.2."" Sometimes, our response to a problem is worse than the problem. Tip: As soon as you feel triggered by a problem, score it on a 1-10 scale.

2012-10-24,Tony NYC suburb welcomes NJ's first pot dispensary,0.08170149466445761,"MONTCLAIR, N.J. -- Across New Jersey, most communities approached about hosting one of the state's first legal medical marijuana dispensaries in out-of-the-way industrial zones have just said no, after outpourings of public opposition.Montclair is a different story.The cosmopolitan suburb a half-hour train ride from Manhattan has not only allowed Greenleaf Compassion Center _ which last week received the state Health Department's first license to begin providing pot to patients _ but also let the business set up in the middle of the town's main drag, and with no fuss.For plenty of people in the way left-of-center town, the situation is a source of both pride and nonchalance.""Why are the other communities so closed-minded as to not accept something like that?"" said Peter Ryby, owner of Montclair Book Store, around the corner and down the block from the not-yet-opened alternative treatment center.The town of 38,000 is sometimes called ""the Upper West Side of New Jersey,"" referring to the famously upscale and liberal part of Manhattan, but it's also reminiscent of well-heeled bohemian spots such as Boulder, Colo., and Berkeley, Calif. There's an art museum, an international film festival, a Whole Foods, Thai restaurants, racks for commuters' bikes, and the headquarters of Garden State Equality, New Jersey's largest gay-rights group.The population _ 62 percent white, 27 percent black _ is racially integrated and largely well-to-do. The median household income is $140,000.And the idea of tolerance is part of the town's identity. In a scene in ""Mad Men,"" a TV drama set in the 1960s, characters who went to Montclair for a party were stunned to see black and white revelers together _ and marijuana being passed around.Medical marijuana is a dicey business. In the eyes of the federal government, the medicine is still an illegal drug.Some patients say marijuana can ease symptoms associated with conditions ranging from multiple sclerosis to migraines. It has been used to treat pain, nausea and lack of appetite in cancer and AIDS patients.Seventeen states and Washington, D.C., have flouted federal law and passed some sort of statute to allow patients access to the drug.Each state has its own model for how the cannabis can be distributed. Some, like New Jersey _ where advocates lament and some officials brag that the laws are the nation's strictest _ are still in a startup phase.So far, nine states _ Arizona, California, Colorado, Maine, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington _ have dispensaries operating. Some states are still setting up distribution systems, and some use home-grown marijuana or other setups that do not include dispensaries.Chris Goldstein, a spokesman for both the Philadelphia chapter of the pro-pot group NORML and the Coalition for Medical Marijuana of New Jersey, has visited dispensaries all over the country. He said most of the storefront operations look more like the one ready to open in Montclair than those proposed in industrial districts of New Jersey.""The dispensaries are in the higher-end neighborhoods of California towns. There are people who are wealthy and who are poor who need to access medical marijuana,"" he said. ""In New Jersey, it's wherever the dispensary can get their location.""New Jersey is not allowing registered patients to grow their own, and is limiting the potency, amount and variety of pot patients can buy. There's a relatively short list of conditions that qualify patients for the drug, and unlike some more lenient states, chronic pain and anxiety aren't on it.Only New Jersey residents are eligible. New York, easily reachable by rail, does not allow medical marijuana, though lawmakers have proposed doing so.Last year, the New Jersey Department of Health selected six nonprofit groups to pursue plans to grow and sell cannabis. The other five have struggled to find towns that will accept them, and none yet has permission to start growing marijuana, let alone sell it.Groups are planning sites in Egg Harbor Township and Woodbridge. The other three groups have not announced their latest location plans.Only Greenleaf has had a direct path. In its application, the group said it would meet patients in Montclair and grow its plants in another, undisclosed town. The group won't say where, citing security.A year ago, Janice Talley, Montclair's director of planning and community development, found that the site on Bloomfield Avenue _ next door to an abortion clinic and three buildings down from an adult video store that has pipes and vaporizers displayed for sale _ would be a permissible for the new business under zoning laws.Talley said she fielded complaints from some national anti-marijuana groups. ""Nobody from the town called me and complained why we had that facility,"" she said. ""It wasn't a huge issue here.""Behind the counter at Health Love and Soul Juice Bar and Grill a couple doors down from Greenleaf, Jarisi Anderson, said he's all for the new establishment. ""It's a beautiful thing,"" he said.His co-worker, Queen Townsend, fears the place could be a problem, but she believes she's in the minority. ""The people I've met in Montclair _ I don't want to stereotype _ a lot of people here smoke weed,"" she said. ""They don't have a problem with that.""The guys smoking tobacco down the street at Fume, a cigar shop, said they aren't troubled by legalizing marijuana _ medicinal or not. ""It's a waste to lock somebody up for a nickel bag or a dime bag,"" said shop owner Ralph Alberto.But the dispensary could give the non-Montclair residents who go there to protest another cause.Last week, Bernadette Grant stood across the street from the dispensary's neighboring abortion clinic with rosary beads in one hand and anti-abortion pamphlets in the other. She said she considers medical marijuana in the same category as abortion.""This is not pro-life ,"" she said. ""This is pro-death.""___Follow Mulvihill at http://www.twitter.com/geoffmulvihill"
2012-10-25,Stocks waver on a big earnings day,0.03177053554412045,"NEW YORK -- A weak showing in home sales and a mixed batch of earnings reports kept the stock market flipping between minor gains and losses on Wall Street. With an hour left in the trading day, the major market indexes were slightly up.A strong profit report from Procter & Gamble helped indexes start higher early Thursday, but they weakened in late morning trading after a realtor group said that the pace of contracts for new home sales had leveled off.That turned the stocks of builders sharply lower. PulteGroup was off 3 percent, giving up an early gain. D.R. Horton fell 2 percent and Toll Brothers fell 3 percent.In afternoon trading Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average was up five points at 13,082. It had climbed as much as 87 points earlier in the day.The Standard & Poor's 500 rose three points to 1,412 and the Nasdaq gained six points to 2,987.""This is a market still working through a difficult earnings season,"" said Jason Pride, the director of investment strategy for Glenmede, a wealth-management firm.Pride said investors probably celebrated too much after the Federal Reserve pledged more support for the economy in early September. They overlooked shrinking economies in Europe, slower growth in China and other signs that this earnings season would be rough. In the past two weeks, they've paid for it.""We had a party and now we're dealing with a hangover,"" he said. ""The market is basically back to where it was at the end of August. I don't think that's unreasonable.""The stock market has been in a slump for more than a week because of the weak revenue numbers and lower profit projections that have emerged from the latest round of corporate earnings reports.The Dow gained 127 points Oct. 16 but since then has managed only two daily gains, both of them meager. The average has lost 474 points since that last significant increase.Among companies reporting earnings Thursday, infant formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition plunged 10 percent after its revenue came in well below what Wall Street analysts were expecting. The company also cut its forecast for full-year earnings and its stocks slumped $6.92 to $62.59.Profits at United Airlines declined with fewer people flying, and the company fell well short of Wall Street expectations. The stock fell 77 cents to $19.50, a loss of 4 percent.Homebuilders fell broadly after the pace of growth in home sales slowed last month. PulteGroup, which returned to profitability in the third quarter, gave up an early gain and was trading down 51 cents at $16.94. Toll Brothers fell 93 to $34.32 and D.R. Horton fell 25 cents to $21.16.Procter & Gamble was the biggest gainer in the Dow after the consumer products company, whose products include Tide, Gillette and Charmin, reported earnings that beat analysts' expectations. P&G rose $1.90 to $69.98.Online game maker Zynga jumped 26 cents to $2.39 after the company reported revenue that was stronger than analysts had anticipated. The company also said it would cut costs and enter the gambling business.Health insurer Aetna rose 38 cents to $44.33 after reporting a 2 percent gain in third-quarter earnings. Higher revenue and lower-than-expected health care claims helped the company beat Wall Street's profit expectations.Apple and Amazon.com report earnings after the market closes.As investors moved into stocks, they sold U.S. government bonds, sending yields higher. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yielded 1.83 percent, up from 1.79 percent late Wednesday."

2012-11-01,Greek journalist tried over Swiss bank list,0.07287581699346404,"* List named Greeks with Swiss bank accounts* Journalist faces up to two years in jail if convicted* Greeks angry over govt's tax evasion* Speed of arrest, trial criticisedATHENS, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Greek lawyers launched their defence of a prominent journalist on Thursday charged with breaking private data rules after he published the names of more than 2,000 wealthy Greeks believed to be holding Swiss bank accounts.The printing of the ``Lagarde List'' by magazine editor Costas Vaxavanis has touched a nerve in almost-bankrupt Greece, where rampant tax evasion is undermining a struggle to cut public costs and raise revenue under an EU/IMF bailout deal.His speedy arrest and trial following publication at the weekend has enraged many here already furious over consecutive governments' failure to crack down on a rich elite, who they blame for years of recession that has wiped out a fifth of economic output and hammered middle-class living standards.Vaxevanis, editor of the ``Hot Doc'' weekly, was surrounded by fellow journalists and other supporters who packed the Athens courtroom as his lawyers began their defence.They argued the prosecution had charged him without any of those on the list having filed a complaint about privacy violation, a rare occurance in a freedom of speech or defamation case in Greece.``He's been accused without reason,'' said Nicos Constantopoulous, his lawyer and a former leftist politician. ``The principles of a fair trial are not being followed.''Under Greek laws covering sensitive data, a defendant must stand trial within 48 hours if arrested within a day of charges being filed in absentia. Vaxevanis faces up to two years in prison if convicted.He has said he received the list, named after International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde who gave it to authorities in several EU countries in 2010 when she was French finance minister, from an anonymous source.Another newspaper, daily Ta Nea, also published the 2,059 names, which includes several politicians as well as many businessmen, shippnig magnates, doctors, lawyers and housewives, over 10 pages.It said the accounts had held about 2 billion euros until 2007 but also made clear that there was no evidence any of them had broken tax evasion laws."
2012-11-01,UPDATE 1-Storm Sandy knocks US Oct auto sales below estimates,0.11780420483908854,"* Sandy caused industry to lose 20,000-25,000 sales -Ford* Industry likely to miss sales estimates for October* Still, GM, Chrysler report best October sales in 5 years* Ford October sales edge up; Toyota's up 16 pct* Ford shares down 1.4 pct, GM down 0.6 pct(Adds results from GM, Ford, Toyota and VW, adds comments by Ford, GM and VW, adds stock prices)DETROIT, Nov 1 (Reuters) - General Motors Co and Chrysler Group LLC both reported their strongest U.S. sales for the month of October since the financial crisis sent both U.S. automakers into bankruptcy, but the destruction of storm Sandy will cause the sector to miss overall sales expectations.Ford Motor Co's sales last month edged up 0.4 percent, while Toyota Motor Corp's sales rose about 16 percent.GM sales rose 4.7 percent to 195,764 vehicles, while those at Chrysler, an affiliate of Italy's Fiat SpA, increased 10 percent to 126,185 vehicles. Both totals were the best either automaker had seen since 2007, before the U.S. economy went into recession and caused a drastic decline in sales that led GM and Chrysler to file for bankruptcy in 2009.Still, results of Ford, Chrysler and Toyota came in below expectations, while GM missed some analysts' estimates, suggesting that the U.S. industry will have a hard time reaching the 14.9 million-vehicle annual sales rate economists had predicted for the month before Sandy pummeled the U.S. East Coast.  Auto sales are an early indicator each month of U.S. consumer demand.The massive storm, which hit New York City on Monday evening, hurt U.S. demand at the end of the month, with Ford officials estimating the lost sales for the entire industry at 20,000 to 25,000 vehicles.Ford officials said that would hurt the annual rate by 300,000 vehicles, although analysts have said the industry would likely make up any lost sales in November. GM officials agreed, saying Sandy hurt the annual rate by at least 300,000 vehicles.GM said it sees an October annual sales rate in the range of 14.4 million vehicles. Ford estimates the rate in the high 14 million range including heavy and medium-duty trucks, in line with GM.Volkswagen AG's U.S. operations chief, Jonathan Browning, said the industry would fall short of the 10 to 11 percent gain many had predicted.``This is not yet a full-blown recovery,'' Browning told reporters on a conference call. ``The overall environment is one of improving optimism, but it's still not a strong positive development in terms of the overall economy.'' He added that demand had been choppy in some regions even before Sandy.Before the massive storm hit, analysts had predicted the industry would show an 11 percent sales gain, led by Toyota and Honda Motor Co, which benefited from increased demand for compact cars as gasoline prices remained high across the country.Many automakers still made gains in the month as rising home prices, attractive vehicle financing options and Americans' growing need to replace their aging cars spurred more consumers to showrooms. That bodes well for the future, a top GM executive said.``Year over year, the light vehicle selling rate has increased for eight consecutive quarters without a tailwind from the residential housing sector, but that is starting to change,'' Kurt McNeil, GM's vice president of U.S. sales operations, said in a statement. ``If these trends continue, housing may be the final piece of the puzzle that lifts sales above 15 million units on an annual basis.''Over the last five years, the U.S. auto sector has undergone a wrenching overhaul that led to plant closures, job losses and the government-financed bankruptcy restructurings of GM and Chrysler. Ford also overhauled its U.S. operations, but did not take a government bailout.The October sales report will be the last before Election Day, marking the end of a contentious U.S. presidential race that has repeatedly thrust GM and Chrysler into the spotlight in televised debates, stump speeches and campaign advertisements.The sales report also caps a busy week for the U.S. auto industry, which saw third-quarter profit reports from all three Detroit automakers.GM shares were down 0.6 percent at $25.34 on Thursday morning, while Ford shares were down 1.4 percent at $11.00. The broad S&P 500 Index  was up 1 percent.(Additional reporting by Paul Lienert and Deepa Seetharaman in Detroit; editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Matthew Lewis)"
2012-11-03,COMMODITIES-Down after post-storm oil supply boost; cocoa jumps,0.0033275058275058327,"* Foreign oil tankers help ease supply crunch in US Northeast* Little focus on better-than-expected US jobs data for Oct* Oil prices lose 2 pct on the day; Brent down 4 pct* Gold hits 2-month low; copper ends down for 4th week* Cocoa rallies on Ghana supply squeeze, bucking weak trendNEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Oil prices tumbled on Friday as foreign tankers were allowed to bring fuel from U.S. ports to the Northeast to ease a supply crunch after Hurricane Sandy, and metals and other key commodities fell on worries the devastation from the storm could hamper the economic recovery. The declines wiped out Thursday's gains that came after markets appeared to gain a sense of normalcy following the massive storm earlier this week that killed at least 102 people. Many in the stricken region were still without power, gasoline and information about when their shattered lives might return to normal. Oil prices fell more than 2 percent on the day, with U.S. crude settling below $85 a barrel and London's Brent finishing under $106. Brent, which affects global oil prices more than U.S. crude, fell nearly 4 percent on the week. Gasoline futures in New York also fell more than 2 percent, to below $2.58 per gallon, as oil tankers and pipelines supplying New Jersey and the New York Harbor - the delivery point for the U.S. contract - restored more operations that had been roiled by the hurricane. The Thomson Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a bellwether for commodities, fell 1.6 percent after 14 of its 19 components settled in negative territory. The selloff came despite a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report for October which ordinarily would have sent prices rallying. While oil and gasoline fell over 2 percent, natural gas was the CRB's biggest loser for the day. It tumbled 4 percent on milder weather forecasts for the U.S. Northeast next week that reduced the potential demand for gas as a heating fuel. Oil came under pressure after the U.S. government temporarily waived Jones Act restrictions on tankers carrying fuel from the Gulf Coast refining hub to the hard-hit Northeast, increasing the fleet of ships that would normally be confined to domestic vessels and crews. ``I think economic uncertainty and next week's (U.S.) elections are weighing on oil prices. You also have the statement that the Jones Act is going to be waived for a week, suggesting some supplies are going to return,'' said analyst Gene McGillian at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.GOLD AT 2-MONTH LOW, COPPER DOWN U.S. gold futures hit a two-month low below $1,700 an ounce and were down almost 2 percent this week, settling at below $1,682 to mark a fourth consecutive weekly decline. Gold has erased all its gains made after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its latest bond buybacks to boost the job market in September. ``Better-than-expected numbers reduced the risk demand for gold, and a drop below $1,700 an ounce triggered sell-stops and momentum selling,'' said James Steel, metals analyst at HSBC. ``There are also long liquidation ahead of elections triggered by the job number,'' Steel said. Copper prices fell for a fourth consecutive week. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at $7,665.50 a tonne in official rings, down 2 percent from Thursday's close of $7,826 a tonne. Corn and soybeans fell about 2 percent each on Midwest harvest projections that suggested both crops may be larger than previously thought.COCOA BUCKS LOWER TREND Cocoa bucked the weakness in other commodities, pushing above technical support levels as some exports faced a holdup and purchases slowed in the main West African growing region. New York-traded cocoa futures closed up $27, or 1.1 percent, at $2,447 per tonne, as traders watched the early progress of main crop harvests in West Africa. The market climbed for a second straight day after hitting its 200-day moving average around $2,352. Cocoa purchases in Ghana, the world's second-biggest producer of the crop, stood at 86,028 tonnes by Oct. 19 in the first week of the season, down 42 percent from the same period a year ago, trade data showed on Thursday. The numbers were lower than expected and were helping to underpin the market, traders said.Prices at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT)"
2012-11-05,Gold as Collateral: Could This Solve the Euro Crisis?,0.10093548264600896,"Debt-crippled euro zone countries could see the yields on their sovereign bonds fall dramatically if they used their gold reserves as collateral for that debt issuance, according to Sylvester Eijffinger, professor of financial economics at Tilburg University.Funding costs have risen to unsustainable levels for several euro zone countries, forcing them to seek financial aid from their fellow euro partners.If governments were to use gold as collateral, sovereign credit risk would be reduced and the European Central Bank would no longer have to buy up debt from struggling euro zone members, Eijffinger told CNBC.The ECB's plan to buy unlimited amounts of short-dated government debt, known as Outright Monetary Transactions or OMT,  has been heavily criticized. Although the scheme eased investors' nerves, many analysts argue it will be equivalent to the ECB printing money to finance governments.Using gold as collateral would pose fewer risks to the ECB's balance sheet than the ECB's recently launched bond-buying program, Eijffinger said.Of all euro zone countries struggling with high debts, Portugal and Italy would benefit most from the method because they hold large reserves of gold. Spain, Ireland and Greece would not gain as much.Italy holds 2450 metric tons of gold, and Portugal has 383 metric tons of gold. This compares to Spain's 282 metric tons of gold, and Greece's 112 metric tons of gold, according to the World Gold Council.Italy holds gold reserves of 24 percent of its two-year funding requirements, for Portugal this is 30 percent, according to the World Gold Council. A recent EU study titled ""A More Effective Euro Area Monetary Policy than OMTs -Gold-Backed Sovereign Debt""  also recommended that the central banks of euro zone countries use gold as collateral for highly distressed bonds to allow the euro area to reduce financing costs, like it did in the past.The study, authored by Professor Ansgar Belke University from the Duisburg-Essen university in Germany shows that in the 1970s Italy and Portugal employed their gold reserves as collateralfor loans from Germany's Bundesbank, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and other institutions like the Swiss National Bank. ""Italy received a $2 billion bail-out from the Bundesbank in 1974 and put up its gold as collateral. More recently, in 1991, India applied its gold as collateral for a loan with the Bank of Japan and others. And in 2008, Sweden's Riksbank used its gold to raise some cash and provide additional liquidity to the Scandinavian banking system,"" the study said.""It would be more transparent, would not be inflationary and would foster reforms,"" the study said.RestrictionsThere are some restrictions to using gold as collateral however.Central banks of euro zone countries along with the Swedish Central Bank and the Swiss Central Bank signed a contract in 2009 which stated they would not put more than 400 tons of gold on the market over the course of the five years that followed.Since the euro zone was formed, all of the gold that euro zone member states hold has been pooled by the ECB. Member states' central banks are not allowed to make decisions over these holdings without getting approval from the ECB.""This may limit the options until 2014, but a country will only have to sell if [it defaulted on its debt]  they do not live up to all the conditions that are being set ,"" Eijffinger said. Dr. Moorad Choudhry, treasurer at RBS corporate banking, told CNBC that the option ""is not a solution to the euro zone's structural problems."" ""It would just be kicking the can down the road and wouldn't solve anything  in the long term,"" he said.""It holds troubled euro zone countries back from taking any critical decisions. The structural problems of these countries need urgent attention, and an ability to borrow cheaper than what they are paying now doesn't address these problems. As a technical option the idea  works, but  for more  emotional  reasons  it probably won't happen ,"" Choudhry said.The ECB declined the comment on the possibility of using gold as collateral.The euro area holds 10,792 tonnes of gold, which is about 6.5 percent of all gold that has ever been mined and worth some $590 billion, according to the European Parliament study. —By CNBC.com's Liza Jansen; Follow Her on Twitter @lizajansen"
2012-12-07,More US Service Jobs Heading Offshore,0.07432760141093475,"The strike that crippled two of the nation's busiest shipping  ports was settled this week, but the trend it spotlighted —  the offshoring of service jobs — is expected to continue to  grow across the USA.  The eight-day walkout by clerical workers at the ports of Los  Angeles and Long Beach largely centered on the outsourcing of  their jobs overseas and to elsewhere in the U.S., says Craig  Merrilees, a spokesman for the International Longshore and  Warehouse Union. Shippers denied outsourcing jobs, but the  tentative settlement restricts the practice, according to the  Associated Press.Service companies have been sending jobs abroad in large  numbers the past decade to cut labor costs — a trend that  accelerated in the recession and is expected to continue the next  few years before slowing after 2016. About 663,000 large-company  jobs in information technology, human resources, finance and  purchasing — the category that includes the port workers  — have been offshored since 2002, according to The Hackett  Group.  By 2016, the consulting firm estimates, another 375,000 jobs in  the sectors will be moved abroad. More than a third of the U.S.  jobs in those industries in 2002 will have moved offshore by  2016.  Most workers are employed directly by companies that previously  used U.S. staffers, though some work for outsourcing firms.  Hackett studied companies with at least $1 billion in annual  revenue, noting they represent about 75% of the offshoring  market.  India is the largest offshoring center. Service jobs also have  gone to eastern Europe, the Philippines, China and Mexico.(Read More: How Immigrants Are Changing U.S. Businesses)  In other sectors, initially low-level jobs were offshored, such  as handling payroll or tracking purchase orders. Employers  typically can cut labor costs by about 75 percent, Dorr says. In recent  years, a growing number of higher-level jobs have moved overseas,  such as benefits analysis and vendor management, though the cost  savings for offshoring those positions is only about 25 percent.The  trend took off after companies began contracting with programmers  in India to help with the massive preparations for the Y2K  computer bug in 2000, says Hackett research director Erik Dorr.  ""Organizations now feel more comfortable moving up the value  chain,"" Dorr says, noting, for example, that India's education  system is improving and turning out top-notch job candidates.  Since 2005, legal services such as document review, contract  drafting and regulatory communication increasingly have been  offshored, particularly to India, says Greg McPolin, managing  director of Pangea3, a legal outsourcing firm. Indian attorneys  handle work that in the U.S. is sometimes done by paralegals and  at a 40 to 60 percent cost savings, he says.  Several thousand legal jobs have been offshored, estimates Edward  Brooks, founder of The LPO Program, a legal consulting firm.  ""In the current environment, it is more important than ever that  … the support we provide to clients adds value without  adding unnecessary cost,"" law firm Clifford Chance said in a  statement.  Once services are offshored, there's little chance they'll come  back to the U.S., Dorr says. By contrast, manufacturers have  returned some production to the U.S. recently, largely because of  a narrowing wage gap between the U.S. and China, rising shipping  costs and falling U.S. energy costs — factors that generally  haven't affected service jobs.  One exception: call-centers. About 500,000 of these jobs were offshored  from 2006 to 2010, according to the Communications Workers of  America. Many have returned to the U.S. the last few years  because of cultural gaps between representatives and customers  that hurt sales, says Hal Sirkin, senior partner of Boston  Consulting Group.  Still, CWA spokeswoman Candice Johnson called the jobs that have  come back ""a drop in the bucket."""
2012-12-10,"Wanting Work, but Stuck in Part-Time Purgatory",0.03543260473588342,"Bonnie Gray knows there are people out there who are worse off  than she is. After all, at least she has a job.  It's just not a full-time gig.Like many other Americans, she  works part time and it's barely enough to pay for food, fuel and  shelter. Millions of Americans were working part time in November  but they would like to have been working full time. These  so-called ""involuntary part-time workers"" are an example of some  of the stubborn pockets of weakness that remain in the labor  market even as the jobs picture improves very slowly.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported Friday that nearly 8.2 million people  classified themselves as involuntary part-time workers in  November, meaning that they settled for less work because they  couldn't get more. That's around double the number of involuntary  part-timers in 2006, before the nation went into recession and  entered a prolonged period of weak recovery.  A separate group of more than 18 million people were working  part-time in November for non-economic reasons, either because  they are in school or they want to spend more time with their  children, for example.  The number of people who are involuntarily underemployed has gone  down since it hit 9 million in the depths of the recession, but  progress has been slow and rocky. 'A Demand Problem'  For people like Gray, 63, improvement can't come soon enough.  Gray, who lives in Cary, Ill., for years worked two jobs: a  full-time administrative job and, for extra money, a part-time  cashier job at a major home retailer. She was laid off from her  full-time position, which paid close to $16 an hour, in January  of 2012.  She was left with a part-time job that pays $12.40 an hour. That  plus some unemployment compensation she receives is barely enough  to cover her mortgage and other expenses. She sometimes relies on  her church for food, and worries what will happen when the  unemployment runs out at the end of the year.  She's spent nearly a year looking for another receptionist or  administrative position.  ""I'm on the computer, it seems, 24/7. I am networking. I've  walked out my resume to 83 companies,"" she said. She's also taken  classes on how to interview and on invoicing, and she plans to  take another one on PowerPoint.  She's had many job interviews in the past 12 months, but no  full-time job offer.  Gray said she can't work any more hours as a cashier because a  tumor on her foot makes it difficult to stand for a long  time.  According to her doctor, the mass isn't cancerous, she said, but  she can't afford to have it removed. Her insurance as a part-time  worker wouldn't be enough to cover the procedure and  rehabilitation.  Gray will turn 64 in February, which means she won't qualify for  Medicare for another year. Until then, she said, she needs a job  that offers health insurance.  She's hoping to avoid dipping into Social Security for as long as  possible because the longer she waits, the more she stands to  collect.  ""I was actually hoping to hang on until 70,"" she said.  She may still be in for a tough slog. Heidi Shierholz, a labor  economist with the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute,  said the basic issue plaguing involuntary part-time workers like  Gray is the same one plaguing the overall labor market: There's  just not enough demand to compel employers to add to their labor  costs substantially.  Shierholz said she expects involuntary part-time workers to  gradually see improvements but ""it is a going to take a long  time.""  ""I think by far the dominant reason that we aren't seeing  employment in both dimensions — full (time) people or  ramping up hours for workers that already are there — is  just a demand problem,"" she said.  Once employers have more work that needs to be done, they'll add  more hours for people to do it. 'Now I Have to Watch Everything'  Debbie Fiore doesn't see that happening any time soon at the  small company where she works.  Fiore, who lives in Nottingham, Md., lost her full-time job with  a long-term care company nearly two years ago, and has struggled  for more than a year to find another job.  A friend connected her with a small company that hired and  trained her for an accounts payable and receivable job. She works  about 25 hours a week and makes about half what she used  to.  Fiore, who turns 57 this week, and her husband struggle to pay  their bills. It's not the situation she envisioned they would be  in heading into their golden years.  ""We're basically living paycheck to paycheck. We're not able to  save anything for the future at this point. There's hardly any  emergency money if an emergency comes up,"" she said.  She's immensely grateful for the job she has, and said she loves  the work. But financial worries weigh heavily on her.  ""I think my attitude, my demeanor has changed,"" she said. ""I used  to be a very carefree, fun person, and now I have to watch  everything."""

2013-02-28,"US Stocks Seen Higher, Boosted by Bernanke Speech ",0.07502266252266251,"U.S. stock index futures signaled a marginally higher open on  Thursday, with European and Asian shares boosted after Federal  Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke reiterated his support for  ultra-easy monetary policy on Wednesday.    In his second day of testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday,  Bernanke said loose monetary policy was boosting  employment.    ""We believe the monetary policies we have conducted have helped  get stronger recovery and more jobs than we otherwise would have  had,"" he said, according to Reuters.    Bernanke forecast it would take three more years for unemployment  to decline to 6 percent, further diminishing concerns the Fed  might tighten policy sooner than expected. Previously, Bernanke  has said he will keep interest rates low until unemployment falls  to around 6.5 percent.    U.S. gains may be capped however by uncertainty about whether a  last-minute deal can be struck to avert the $85 billion of  spending cuts, known as the ""sequester"", due to hit on  Friday.    In his testimony, Bernanke warned Congress of the dangers of  failing to reach an agreement on how to combat  sequestration.    ""I think there is some cost to the economy of these repeated, I  won't say 'crises,' but these repeated episodes where Congress is  unable to come to some agreement and therefore some automatic  thing kicks in. I think that is on the whole not a good thing for  confidence,"" Bernanke said on Wednesday, according to  Reuters.   Meanwhile, a heavy day for economic releases will get underway  with the government's release of its latest estimate of fourth  quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at 8:30 a.m. New York time.  Economists polled by Reuters forecast a sharp rise on the  previous estimate, to 0.5 percent annualized growth, after the  previous forecast suggested GDP declined by 0.1 percent in the  fourth quarter.    ""This upward revision is likely to be a result of both exports  and consumption being higher than previously thought,"" wrote Paul  Dales, a U.S. economist at independent research firm Capital  Economics, in a note on Wednesday afternoon.    ""What's more, despite the expiry of the payroll tax cut in  January, the early evidence suggests that GDP growth accelerated  in the first quarter of this year.""   Hopes for upbeat first quarter growth figures were boosted by  Wednesday's release of durable goods data for January from the  Commerce Department. Core orders, excluding transportation,  posted their biggest gain since December 2011, rising 1.9 percent  month-on-month.    In a note on Wednesday, Peter Newland, a U.S. economist at  Barclays, said that taking into account the durable goods data  numbers, he forecast 1.3 percent growth in the first  quarter.    Other economic data out on Thursday includes the Labor  Department's weekly initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m.  Economists polled by Reuters forecast there were 360,000 new  claims in the week ending February 23, down from 362,000 in the  previous week.   The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) of manufacturing  activity is due at 9:45 a.m. Analysts polled by Reuters predict a  reading of 54.3 for February, down from 55.6 percent last month.  PMI index readings above 50 signal an increase or improvement on  the prior month, while readings below 50 indicate a decrease.   Also, the Energy Department will issue its weekly look at natural  gas inventories across the U.S. at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday.  Inventories fell by 127 billion cubic feet in the prior week.   On the corporate front, Thursday will be a busy day for retail  earnings, with Best Buy, Kohl's, and Barnes & Noble posting  results before the start of U.S. trade.    Barnes & Noble's results will be eyed with interest after  stakeholder Liberty Media said on Wednesday that it had the power  to block a sale of the bookseller, and is waiting to hear if  Barnes & Noble Chairman Leonard Riggio will make an  offer.    Sears Holdings reported forecast-beating earnings for the fourth  quarter early on Thursday.   Groupon shares will also be watched, after the discount voucher  provider lost a quarter of its market value on Wednesday when it  revealed it had started taking a smaller commission on deals  during the holidays, in order to retain merchants.    - By CNBC's Katy Barnato"

2013-04-09,What to Expect From Apple: Analyst,0.012099867724867704,"For its stock to perform once again, Apple needs to provide investors with some level of  confidence in its future, BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk said  Tuesday.  ""I'm a little surprised by the lack of capital allocation,"" he  said. ""A lot of people were expecting something to happen in  March, and when it didn't, then the fear started to creep in.""  On CNBC's ""Fast Money,"" Piecyk  issued a ""buy"" rating for Apple on March 14 with a price target  of $540 per share.  Piecyk said that the upgrade was based on a belief that Apple was  en route to grow its earnings nominally.  ""They've got all these people staring at these screens on their  iPhones, and there's a lot of ways to monetize that, whether it's  through payment systems or ecommerce,"" he said.  ""I think the problem with Apple right now is people are just  questioning whether they can ever return to growth, whether they  had a peak earnings year last year that they'll never get back  to. If you can just return some level of confidence that they can  return to growth, then the stock will do very well, very  quickly.""  Piecyk took a balanced view of Apple's performance.  ""What we're looking for is a bad March quarter, frankly, that's  below where the consensus is now, even though you've had massive  cuts continually. Every week, you've got a different cut,"" he  said. ""But more importantly, the June guide is the real risk  here, and that June guide is going to be a down revenue quarter,  perhaps earnings under 8.

2013-04-17, Did EA Bust the Social Gaming Bubble?,0.0842741216336722,"When Electronic Arts bought social games maker Playfish for $300  million—plus a $100 million buyout—in 2009, it sent shock  waves throughout the videogame industry. Spurred by growing  speculation about the value of then-private Zynga, some tech pros  say it was the beginning of a bubble for developers who  specialize in Facebook games.  On Monday, EA once again surprised the tech world – this  time by announcing plans to axe several games on the social  network, including The Sims Social, SimCity Social and Pet  Society. When those titles shut down on June 14, Playfish may not  have any active games—thus raising questions about its  fate. (EA declined to discuss the future of Playfish, saying it  was ""not commenting on individual teams."")  The Sims Social was once one of the most popular games on  Facebook, with daily active users topping 10 million. It has  fallen off of those highs, though, in a big way: Today, the game  boasts just 500,000 daily players, according to App Data –  and may soon fall out of the Top 100 Facebook titles; it's  currently ranked 98th.  (Read More: EA Puts Faith in 'Next Gen Consoles')  EA is just the latest videogame maker to distance itself from  social network (though games from its PopCap division will  continue to be playable there). Zynga, once the king of  Facebook games has been steadily shifting its focus to  mobile games and real world gambling to increase revenues.(Read More: Gaming Industry's Latest Idea: Free Games)   While Facebook officials have recently begun talking up games as  part of the company's strategy, analysts note the site has failed  to find a way to handle notifications without them appearing  spam-like, causing players to lose some interest and developers  to move elsewhere. A Facebook spokesman has disputed this,  recently telling Gamasutra game installs are up 75 percent  compared to a year ago.   While EA won't confirm the shutdown, Playfish staffers seemed to  hint at the situation on the Playfish forums.  The developer  encouraged players to use their Playfish cash cards—gift  cards bought at retail stores that can be used to purchase  in-game items in any of the developer's titles—before The  Sims Social sunsets. ""After that date, you will need to contact  customer service regarding your Playfish cash cards,"" the  developer said—indicating no future games were  forthcoming.  The apparent end of Playfish games is just the latest in a series  of recent misfortunes for EA. In March, CEO John Riccitiello  announced his resignation (chairman Larry Probst is filling the  position in a temporary basis now). In the weeks leading up to  that, the launch of a much anticipated reboot of ""SimCity"" was  marred by online server problems that prevented many players from  being able to access the game, which required an Internet  connection.  And just last week, EA laid off an undisclosed number of  employees as part of a streamlining movement to become more  efficient and sharpen its focus. And that action came days after  EA was named the ""Worst Company in America"" by consumer watchdog  website The Consumerist for the second year in a row. (In an open  letter to gamers last week, EA chief operating officer Peter  Moore said the company could do better, but added the label of  ""worst company"" was undeserved.)  Analysts say Playfish appears to have been a bet that just didn't  work out for the company.  ""In the final analysis,  Riccitiello probably didn't manage the company's cash well  enough,"" says Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities.  ""They  made a lot of acquisitions that, in 20/20 hindsight, weren't  worth it—including Playfish.""  The Playfish acquisition was the spark that led to enormous  valuations and takeover prices of social gaming companies. Soon  after EA's purchase, Disney   laid out $563 million for Playdom—a company which, at the  time, had a much smaller reach than Playfish. And in 2011, EA  paid $750 million for PopCap Games.  Facebook, though, has become a less important platform for games  in recent years as mobile games have shown a significantly  stronger growth pattern. Playfish never really made that  transition. ""The perception was Facebook would grow unabated,""  says Pachter. ""There's still money to be made, but it's hard to  stand out. The opportunity for growth is much smaller than people  thought.""  ""There have been a lot of [developers and publishers] pulling out  of Facebook,"" adds Billy Pidgeon, an independent market research  analyst. ""But I would have like to have heard [EA is] keeping  some other aspect of social. Certainly, they can keep it going to  some degree with PopCap, but most other people are moving  aggressively toward mobile and away from social.""  Despite the recent move, Pachter remains bullish about EA's  future.

2013-04-18,Could China's Bird Flu Be the Next SARS?,0.14259477895841532,"As the death toll from a deadly strain of bird flu in China rises  to 17, China watchers say they are closely following Beijing's  handling of the outbreak although officials appear to have  learned a trick or two from the SARS crisis a decade ago.  Eight fresh cases of the H7N9 bird flu virus have been reported  in the eastern provinces of China this week, bringing the total  figure of those infected to 82, Reuters reported. China is also  investigating the possibility of human-to-human transmission of  bird flu, a top Chinese health official was quoted as saying on  Thursday.  Some analysts are drawing parallels with the outbreak of severe  acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) between 2002 and 2003, which  damaged international trade between China and  other countries and led to the virtual shut down of Beijing, China's  capital city.  If the bird flu epidemic accelerates in a similar fashion,  investor sentiment could be severely damaged, said one analyst.  ""The obvious benchmark is SARS. That was a catastrophe and the  Chinese government learnt a lot of lessons from that,"" said Tim  Condon, head of research for Asia at ING Financial Markets.  ""At the moment the bird flu outbreak appears to be under control,  but if it turns out to be much more virulent than expected you  could see the same sort of reaction as we saw to SARS,"" he said.  The outbreak of SARS, a viral respiratory disease spread between  humans, in South China and Hong Kong between the end of 2002 and  the summer of 2003, affected around 8,000 and led to more than  700 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Beijing  was criticized at the time for its handling of the outbreak and  downplaying the crisis, which led to panic and hurt China's  economy.  (Read More: )  All About Confidence   Since the fresh strain of bird flu first emerged a few weeks ago  China has slaughtered thousands of birds and closed some live  poultry markets. YUM Brands, which runs the popular KFC  brand in China, has said its March sales in its China restaurants  fell 13 percent because of bird flu worries.  (Read More: Yum's China  Sales Fall Sharply Amid Bird-Flu Scare)  Russia has started introducing medical check-ups for passengers returning  from China, according to press reports, raising worries that  China's tourism industry could be hurt by the bird-flu outbreak.  Condon said Beijing seems to be handling the outbreak differently  in comparison to the SARS crisis and that was good for investor  confidence.  ""Back in 2003, they (Chinese authorities) were hiding the real  numbers, and they even punished the doctor who revealed them. It  was a real disaster. The authorities have now learned from that,  and that means there is maybe a lower risk of a SARS level of  panic,"" he added.  Alistair Chan, an economist at Moody's Analytics, agreed that the  way China handles virus outbreaks has improved since SARS.  ""The reaction seems much more mature,"" he said. ""The government  is getting the U.S. and Australia to advise them on the issue and  there is less of a cover up going on.""  So far the impact on Chinese markets appears to be limited  although analysts say bird flu concerns could be a contributing  factor to weakness in Chinese equities markets, which have taken  a hit from news on Monday of an unexpected fall in China's  first-quarter economic growth.  (Read More: Has China's Economy Hit a 'Dead End'?)  ""There is some talk about it (bird flu) but people don't seem to  be worried,"" said Michael Klibaner, head of Greater China  research property company Jones Lang LaSalle in Shanghai, which  has seen the most cases of bird flu in recent weeks. ""There is no  evidence of human-to-human transmission. If I see evidence of  that, then of course I would have a very different view.""  Patrick Chovanec, managing director and chief strategist at  Silvercrest Asset Management, said he was carefully watching how  bird flu outbreak would impact the economy.  ""What is important to investors is how much this will disrupt the  Chinese economy. Will it affect day-to-day business? Will it stop  people transporting between cities? These practical implications  are what will make people sit up and take notice,"" he added."

2013-05-13, Is the Fed Prepping Markets for the End of QE? ,0.048329201101928385,"If an article in Monday's Wall Street Journal is anything to go  by, the U.S. Federal Reserve is getting ready to unwind its  massive monetary stimulus program. And that prospect is unlikely  to be as alarming for financial markets as feared, analysts tell  CNBC. Fed officials have mapped out a strategy to wind down its $85  billion-a-month bond-buying program in careful steps, although  the timing of when that will start is still being debated, noted  Fed watcher Jon Hilsenrath wrote in the WSJ. Any unwinding of the Fed's quantitative easing (QE) program,  which has fueled a rally in equity markets and other risk assets,  is generally viewed as negative and any indication of this  happening has been highly anticipated in the U.S. since late last  week. (Read More: If I Were 'Dictator,'QE Would End Now, Fed's Lacker  Says) ""Having spent two New York sessions pricing in a sharp change in  Fed stance, it is not obvious that the article was worth the  wait,"" analysts at Westpac said in a note. ""The timing of the  unwinding of QE remains data-dependent, not a serious prospect  until perhaps late U.S. summer at the earliest.""Analysts say that in essence, the Fed appears to be managing  market expectations that its quantitative easing program will not  last forever.The Fed has said that it would maintain its key interest rate  between zero and 0.25 percent until the unemployment rate fell to  6.5 percent. It has also committed to monthly purchases of bonds  until labor market conditions improve substantially. (Read More: Are Bond Vigilantes Taking On the Fed?) And it is the recent signs of improvement in the jobs market that  has renewed talk about a possible end to the quantitative  easing. The latest non-farm payrolls report showed the U.S. economy  created 165,000 new jobs last month, much more than expected,  helping push the unemployment rate down to 7.5 percent. Data last  week meanwhile showed jobless claims at their lowest level in  almost 5-1/2 years. (Read More: Back in Business: Jobs Picture Brightens in April) ""The timing is still a bit uncertain, but our view is that there  will be no more QE from the United States after December this  year,"" said Geoff Lewis, global market strategist, J.P. Morgan  Asset Management.""They're [Fed officials] not going to raise interest rates  they've told us that until unemployment comes down to 6.5  percent, but that could be as soon perhaps as the first half of  next year,"" he added. Lewis said that the Fed would have no choice but to taper off QE  in the face of stronger economic news and that was unlikely to  lead to alarm in equity markets that have thrived on the  aggressive monetary stimulus.U.S. stocks hit fresh highs on Friday, while markets in Asia and  Europe have also seen stellar gains this year. ""That [an easing of QE] would be good for U.S. stocks because it  would mean the U.S. economy is doing a lot better,"" he said.Martin Lakos, division director, Macquarie Private Wealth told  CNBC Asia's ""Squawk Box"" that he also remained positive on the  outlook for stocks.""The central bank is clearly trying to massage markets that QE is  not going to be around there forever.

2013-07-17,'Rolling Stone' Boston bomber photo stirs debate; CVS drops the issue,0.13646920019870842,"Rolling Stone magazine sparked a heated social media debate today  after releasing a cover image promoting an upcoming profile of  alleged Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.   The Twitter and Facebook firestorm resulted in calls for boycotts, and drugstore chain CVS announcing that it would not carry the  issue in its 7,000 stores nationwide.  ""As a company with deep roots in New England and a strong  presence in Boston, we believe this is the right decision out of  respect for the victims of the attack and their loved ones,"" the  statement said. CVS is headquartered in Woonsocket, R.I.  The cover, released online as a preview to Friday's edition with  an in-depth article chronicling Tsarnaev's life leading up to the  Boston Marathon bombing, features a ""selfie""—or self-taken  photo—by Tsarnaev with the teen's hair falling across his face.  Some online noted that the photo called to mind previous Rolling  Stone covers of Jim Morrison or Bob Dylan and glorified the  teenage suspected killer. Others pointed out that the photo had  also appeared on major news sites like The New York Times in the  days after Tsarnaev's capture.  ""This is obviously a big story and there are a lot of people who  are going to be interested in it, but in my mind it isn't  deserving of the cover,"" said Duran Fernandez-O'Brien, who lives  in Boston and joined the ""Boycott Rolling Stone Magazine for  their latest cover"" Facebook page.  Tsarnaev is suspected of setting off two bombs at the Boston  Marathon with his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, on April 15.  At his first public appearance since his arrest, Tsarnaev pleaded  not guilty to 30 charges brought against him by federal  prosecutors in the U.S. District Court.  Fernandez-O'Brien echoed other online critics, voicing concern  over whether the magazine is glorifying Tsarnaev and his actions  by giving him so much attention.""Obviously it's what people want to see,"" he said. ""Definitely. But at the  same time it creates a culture where people who may be on the  fringe of thinking about doing something like that will then push  forward and go through their ideas because they think this will  make me famous: 'I will leave my mark history if I do something  like this.' ""   Instead of focusing on the bombers, the media should focus on the  victims, Fernandez-O'Brien said.  MBTA officer Richard ""Dic"" Donohue, who was shot during a  chaotic exchange of gunfire with the Tsarnaev brothers following  the bombing, released a statement voicing his thoughts on the  cover.  ""My family and I were personally affected by these individuals'  actions. I cannot and do not condone the cover of the magazine,  which is thoughtless at best,"" he said. ""I am confident that our Boston Strong community will remain  intrepid and unshaken by the cover of this magazine.""  Others, including journalism professor at Northeastern University and  frequent media commentator Dan Kennedy, argue that the cover  choice is not only not controversial, but a smart editorial  decision on behalf of Rolling Stone.  ""I think it's important to be responsible,"" he said. ""It's nice to say that  we should keep our focus on the victims of this awful crime and  not glamorize someone like Tsarnaev, and I agree with that, but  at the same time I think that we all want to know what drove him  to commit this terrible crime, and he's interesting, and that's  the definition of news.""   Kennedy did agree that Tsarnaev looks glamorous on the over, but  that every picture he has seen of the alleged bomber from the  Boston Globe to The New York Times shows Tsarnaev in the same  way.  He also noted the magazine's history of featuring high-profile  news as feature and cover stories, such as its 1970 cover of  Charles Manson.""I suppose you could say this one was glammed up to an  unusual degree, but I thought it really worked very well because  it was an exercise in cognitive dissonance,"" he said.  ""You look at the type and it says 'the bomber and how he turned  into a monster,' then you look at the glammed-up shot of him and  at the word 'bomber,' and you see a monster.""

2013-07-28,Banking stem cells in the hope of a lifesaving cure ,0.14912846666271318,"Forget about cash—start banking your body.  Using a technology that echoes science fiction movies, a French company is offering people a ""bank"" to store  their own stem cells for years in a bet that those cells may be used to grow replacement organs and possibly  save their lives someday.  ""It's a personal deposit of your cell,"" said Dr. André  Choulika, CEO of the biotech company Cellectis, which  is launching the stem-cell bank known  as Scéil this month.  Given the rate of developments in stem-cell research and their  potential for curbing health costs, Choulika thinks  Scéil's model of creating and storing stem cells one day  will become so cheap that it will become mandatory for people  with medical insurance.  ""This pace of science currently goes so fast, probably in a few  years, less than 10 years, everyone will have their own cell  backup, and it will be a requirement,"" said Choulika, whose  company is named after the Gaelic word for ""story,"" and is  pronounced ""sail"" by Choulika.   ""We believe that regenerative medicine is the future,"" he   said.   In the present, though, it is anything but  cheap. Scéil's services cost $60,000, Choulika said,  adding that it is ""a one-time payment, for your life.""  (Read more: Hot biotech  IPOs)  Choulika said he expects enthusiastic adoption by wealthy  clients, as has been seen with other new technologies.  Then, system improvements and competition could drive the  initial price down considerably.  ""It's expensive, or it seems expensive, for one reason,"" Choulika  said. ""We don't know how many people are going to sign up,  and it's a very complex and sophisticated technology,"" he said. The number of people now who could both afford the  process and be interested in trying it might top 1 million.The company says it has already signed customers, though it doesn't wish to reveal details about them. Those clients will be putting down a hefty sum on a  bet that that outlay will be more than offset by the benefits  realized from scientific breakthroughs in coming decades.  A depositor at Scéil will make an appointment with a  dermatologist, who will take ""a small puncture out of your skin,  under the arm, 3 millimeters in diameter,"" Choulika  said. ""Then the sample is shipped to our treatment center,  which is located in Singapore."" (He was visiting Scéil's facility there when he spoke to CNBC.com in a phone interview.)  (Read more: We  Americans are healthy, really!)  The skin cells are grown in the lab and genetically manipulated  with enzymes in a way that reverts them to a stem-cell  state.   ""It's like a computer that you want to reboot, and you want to  rewrite the hard drive all in zeros,"" Choulika said. ""The cells  totally forget what they are, and go back to 'stage zero' in  life.""  Then those stem cells are themselves grown in ""a very large  sample,"" he said. Afterward, the cultivated stem cells are  split into three ""very large"" batches and stored in Scéil  locations in Singapore, Switzerland and Dubai. The separation  acts as a fail-safe measure.  Because of the accumulation of mutations in a person's DNA, the earlier a deposit in a stem-cell bank is made, the better, though ""it's never too late,"" Choulika  said.  The technology that Scéil uses is based on research that  won Japanese physician Shinya Yamanaka the 2012 Nobel Prize for  Medicine.  (Read more: High medical bills drive bankruptcy)  For years, scientists believed that embryonic stem cells—the  cells that can generate all the types of cells in a person's  body—could be obtained only from embryos or blood in the  umbilical cord. That meant that unless umbilical blood was  collected at birth, there was no way to use existing cells to  cultivate new ones that later technologies might be able to grow  into full organs, blood or bones.  ""That was the paradigm,"" Choulika said. ""You could  never go back to the stage of stemness, like an embryonic cell,  the first stage of life,"" ""The stem cell, from the beginning of  life, gives you any kind of tissue. However, you can never go back  from there. ... Once you have a skin cell, the skin cell remains  a skin cell.""  But Yamanaka shattered that paradigm when he discovered in 2006  that ""intact mature cells in mice could be reprogrammed to become  immature stem cells"" when a cocktail of several genes were introduced into the mature cells, the Nobel Committee noted in  announcing the award last year.""With any cell of a person, then, you can rebuild any kind of  tissue,"" Choulika said. ""You can rebuild neurons; you can rebuild  blood. You can rebuild anything.""At the moment, the technology of building tissue on a large  scale is in its infancy, and years away from being able to grow  so-called pluripotent stem cells into full organs for transplant  into their donors.  Movement toward that goal was seen earlier this month, when the Japanese government approved the world's first clinical  trials using such stem cells for treating age-related  blindness. That conjures images of  the 1982 dystopian cult classic ""Blade  Runner,"" in which a memorable scene involves a scientist  working in a lab where human eyes are grown.  The cultivated stem cells also could be used to test drugs' efficacy and risks.—By CNBC's Dan Mangan. Follow him on  Twitter @_DanMangan."
2013-08-16,Yoshikami: Paulson sold gold? So what!,0.1625981576562972,"After months of reading headlines that John Paulson's  perspective on gold had not changed, we suddenly read that he had cut  his holdings significantly.  Just three months ago, he was quoted as saying that his thesis  remains intact, but then we find that Paulson tactically adjusted his  portfolios and reduced his gold position. What gives?  While one might be tempted to conjure up scenarios where words do  not match actions, we think it's more a function of examining  current conditions and making a new decision. And that is the  risk associated with reading headlines and making investment  decisions based on the latest comments from anyone: Those  opinions can change, and they often do.  The market is quite irrational. Gold has become the flag  bearer for an environment with less predictability. Gold used to  be a fairly predictable trade against inflation and volatility.  Now gold trades based on Federal  Reserve comments, interest rates, fear, hedge fund liquidity  needs, etc.  (Read more: With  Paulson's exit, is the worst over for gold?)  It's quite a puzzle to figure out and one we as an asset  manager have decided not to attempt to decipher.  In many ways it's no different than the sentiment-based trading  around Apple.   The company still has over $100 billion cash in the bank; the stock  in the last 12 months has gone from $700 to $390 to $500, and nothing  really has changed on a fundamental basis. This position is  trading based on expectations and sentiment, and we expect this to  continue in the short term. Long term, Apple will trade based on fundamentals; short-term and trades on mood and feeling;  not terribly rational inputs.  The market trades based on data, current perception of that data and future expectations. And institutional as well as individual  investors either know that fact and invest accordingly, or they are  subject to these rapidly changing trading conditions and are  victims.   (Read more: Breaking  Buffett: The Oracle has underperformed)  This is why it is important to understand the time horizon is key  when determining your investment strategy.  If you are a short-term investor you better have a pretty good  handle on mood and sentiment. If you are a long-term investor you  better have a pretty good concept of the fundamentals and trends  that will affect the asset you are investing in.  And perhaps most importantly, remember that when you read  headlines or hear interviews that opinions change and often do.  Use interviews, columns, insights and protestations from those  in the media as information to consider but not gospel and  certainly not permanent ideology.  This means that in the end your opinion matters as well as well  as your interpretation of others' viewpoints.  (Read more: This might  be when the market returns to normal)  So the next time you read a headline that a prominent investor  has adjusted a strategy after making previous statements  about the wisdom of a particular course of action, remember that perspectives change.

2013-09-25,German consumer morale hits highest level in 6 years,0.10043715846994535,"German consumer confidence rose to its highest level in six years  heading into October, supporting expectations strong consumer  spending will help Europe's largest economy to post moderate  growth in 2013.  GfK market research group said on Wednesday its forward-looking  consumer sentiment indicator, based on a survey of around 2,000  people, rose to 7.1 going into October from an upwardly revised  7.0 the previous month.  The original September figure was 6.9 and analysts in a Reuters  poll had forecast the October reading at 7.0. The strengthening  data chimed with other recent releases suggesting gradual but  steady growth for the end of the year.  ""German consumers are expecting the economy to gain momentum in  the next few months,"" GfK said in a statement. ""There is a clear  upwards trend.""  (Read more: Germans  give Merkel a mandate but markets muted)  Germans, traditionally savers, became more willing to spend in  September than at any point since December 2006, encouraged by an  essentially stable job market and historically low interest  rates. Saving appeared less attractive as inflation overtook bank  interest rates.  A sub-index tracking consumers' income expectations eased, albeit  from a high level, due to rising food prices, which dampened  perceived purchasing power.  ""It's also possible that some consumers fear further financial  burdens due to the euro crisis or tax hikes,"" the GfK said,  referring to the outcome of the German election which was still  uncertain at the time of the survey.  Angela Merkel's conservatives romped to victory in Sunday's  election, winning 42 percent of the vote, but are in need of a  coalition partner after falling just short of a parliamentary  majority.

2013-10-22,Chilling Saudi-US relations not expected to heat up oil market,0.0069168576521517755,"Signs of friction between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have caught  the attention of the oil market, but traders aren't concerned  about supply issues for now.  Saudi Arabia has been unhappy about the U.S. approach to Syria  and Iran, and it is apparently making that clear in diplomatic  circles. Last week, it turned down a two-year term on  the U.N. Security Council in protest against inaction over Syria, even  though that body oversees the United Nation's handling  of Syria.  ""With all the supply issues we've had from all the countries  throughout the Arab spring, the Saudi's have consistently filled  the gap,"" said John Kilduff of Again Capital. ""We have to  watch if they would, not use oil as a weapon, but as a tool to  teach us a lesson that they are unhappy.""  News reports Tuesday quoted sources saying that Prince Bandar Bin  Sultan al-Saud, the kingdom's respected and powerful intelligence  chief, told European diplomats last weekend that he plans to cut  back cooperation with the U.S. on arming and training Syrian  rebels, in protest of U.S. policy in the region.  (Read more: Everything  (energy-related) is bigger in Texas)  ""I don't think it's going to affect our oil relationship,"" said  Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. ""But I do think  there's a lot of turmoil in the Middle East, and you certainly  have the Saudis—who dislike the Iranians—upset about  the fact there could be a thawing relationship between the U.S.  and Iran. ... The Saudis have been showing their displeasure for  some time.""  Lipow said the U.S. will continue to be an important market to  Saudi Arabia, which owns 50 percent of the Motiva refinery in  Texas in a joint venture with Shell.   ""They just finished spending $10 billion in Port Arthur on the  expansion,"" he said.  Iran's new president Hassam Rouhani has been on a  ""charm offensive,"" since visiting the U.N. last month.  He  received a historic phone call from President Barack Obama as he  was leaving New York, breaking 30 years of silence between leaders  of the two countries.   Rouhani has said Iran has no intention of developing  nuclear weapons. Analysts do not expect sanctions to be lifted any  time soon, even if there is progress in the talks. But Reuters  reported Tuesday that Iran is already reaching out to its old oil  buyers and is talking price cuts if sanctions are lifted.   As for Syria, the Obama Administration was adamant about making  the regime there accountable for the deaths of civilians from a  gas attack. The U.S. prepared to bomb the country but reversed  course at the last minute and the UN has now taken the lead. Saudi Arabia had been lobbying for the temporary seat on the  Security Council, so it was surprising when the kingdom turned it  down, citing the council's ineffectiveness in dealing with Syria  and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   Brent crude, reflecting the international oil price, ticked  slightly higher on the report but slipped back. West Texas  Intermediate, on the other hand, was sharply lower after delayed  U.S. inventory data showed a supply buildup in domestic crude.  WTI futures fell below their 200-day moving average of  $98.60 for the first time since June. The futures, scheduled to  expire at the close of business Tuesday, dipped $1.42 to close at  $97.80.   The December contract was trading just above $98. ""It looks the  same ... very bearish on a technical basis,"" Kilduff said of  the December contract. ""The U.S. refining industry has slowed  from its summer peak, and that's allowing the crude oil  inventories to really replenish and build back up, given the  surge in shale production.""  The Saudis have been instrumental in the West's embargo on Iranian oil. Iran is being sanctioned for its nuclear program,  which it says is not for weapons use. An improvement in U.S.-Iran relations would return more than 1 million barrels a day to  the world market.  ""They really don't want that Iranian oil back on the market,""  said Tradition Energy analyst Gene McGillian. It may be  that the Saudis withdrew from the Security Council because  they are more comfortable working behind the scenes, he added.   The Saudis have been producing record amounts of oil to  make up the for the shortfall from Iran. Saudi output is over 10 million barrels a day. The U.S. has supplanted Russia this year as the world's largest producer of both  oil and gas, but in oil production the  Saudis remain at the top.  The U.S. produced 7.4 million barrels a day in the week ended  Oct. 11, down from 7.8 million barrels the week earlier.  Saudi Arabia exported an average of 1.4 million barrels a day  of total petroleum liquids to the United States last year, up  from 1.2 million in 2011. That represented 16 percent of U.S.  crude imports and was second only to those from Canada.  (Read more: Three possible winners from Kenya's oil  explosion)  U.S. oil inventory data for last week is expected to be reported  Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. ET, and McGillian expects to see another  build of 3 million barrels. He was skeptical that the Saudi  reports affected oil markets.  ""I don't think it really spilled over into the oil market,"" he  said. ""There are reports the Saudis are going to try to increase  their production to put pressure on Iran but they do that  anyway.""  McGillian said there's plenty of reasons for U.S. oil to remain  depressed, and the spread is widening dramatically with Brent. ""We pumped nearly 19 million barrels back into storage in the  United States in the last four weeks,"" he said, ""and you haven't seen a  pickup in demand."" —By CNBC's Patti Domm.

Annual euro zone consumer price inflation rose by 0.9 percent  in November, slightly more than economists had predicted,  while further data revealed the first fall in euro zone  unemployment in almost three years.

2013-12-06,These 12 banks are the heart of monetary policy,0.11835671530115972,"The fed funds market is where officials set what is probably the world's most  important interest rate—yet very few people  understand its current operations.This is the market at which the Federal Reserve directs its  primary energies.The Federal Open Markets Committee targets a  level or range for interest paid on overnight fed fund loans,  which are dollar-denominated loans of U.S. dollars between  financial institutions. The trading desk at the New York Fed buys  or sells Fed funds in order to get fed funds to trade at the  targeted level.In the textbook narrative about the fed funds market, some banks  borrow fed funds in order to meet their reserve requirements  while other banks lend fed funds in order to earn a return on  excess reserves. But this isn't quite right—and hasn't been  right since the financial crisis struck, as a new note from the  New York Fed shows.  Prior to the crisis, the lenders in the fed funds market  resembled the textbook narrative. That is, they were a somewhat  diverse group of financial institutions. Domestic bank  holding companies lent out 25 percent of the $221.7 billion of  fed funds traded in the second quarter of 2007, according to data assembled by the New York Fed. Foreign entities  accounted for 21.2 percent of fed funds lending. Stand-alone  commercial banks were 8.2 percent of the market. The regional  Federal Home Loan Banks collectively accounted for 45.3 percent  of the market.   In the last quarter of 2012, things were very different.The  market for fed funds had shrunk down to $60.28 billion and  lending was overwhelmingly dominated by the Federal Home Loan  Banks, which accounted for 73 percent of the fed funds lent. Bank  holding companies had shrunk to 13.6 percent, foreign entities to  just 5.8 percent, and stand-alone banks to 6.4 percent.  In other words, the fed funds market is nothing like the textbook  model of a variety of banks with different reserve positions  making deals with each other to reach a market equilibrium. It's  mostly banks borrowing fed funds from the Federal Home Loan  Banks.   To put it differently, the primary tool of monetary  policy—the FOMC target rate—now is mostly used to  influence overnight fed funds lending by Federal Home Loan  Banks.  Why the transformation?    The New York Fed offers a couple of explanations. First and  foremost, the Fed now pays interest on excess reserves. This  means that banks won't lend reserves if the rate in the fed funds  market is less that what they can earn by holding on to their  reserves in accounts at the Fed. The Federal Home Loan Banks,  however, are government-sponsored entities that aren't allowed to  earn interest on excess reserves. So they'll lend out reserves  even at very low rates.  In addition, quantitative easing has greatly increased the  amount of reserves in the system, which means that banks are less  likely to find that they have too few reserves to meet the  regulatory requirements.  (Read more: Is the Fed really driving up stock prices?)  There is something strikingly odd about this arrangement. Our  central bank is now setting monetary policy by targeting an  interest rate charged by the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks that were  established by Congress and are regulated by the Federal Housing  Finance Authority.      Sophisticated observers of the banking system have long pointed  out that banks do not ""lend out"" reserves. Rather  they make loans first and, if they are short required reserves,  find the reserves afterward on the fed funds market. We now need  to modify this with the observation that, by and large, banks  acquire the reserves not from some diverse ""fed funds market"" but  from the Federal Home Loan Banks.

2014-01-20,There's more than one way to invest in solar power,0.09684085755514323,"Solar companies, already benefiting from booming share prices,  are turning to increasingly innovative ways to raise capital,  including bond issues, bank loans and even  crowd-funding. SolarCity—Wall Street's newest renewable energy darling—last week announced that it will offer debt  investments backed by pools of solar assets this year. Last year,  SolarCity, which is backed by Tesla Motors founder Elon Musk, issued  about $54.4 million in the first-ever solar bonds. They secured  an investment-grade rating from Standard & Poor's. (Read more: A day in the sun: Solar's  revival sends stocks on a tear)Observers say SolarCity's fortunes are the latest signs of  a maturation process that could hasten the day when renewable  energy is less dependent on government subsidies. It also comes  as demand for solar power is expected to see what research firm  NPD calls ""explosive growth,"" with demand expected to surge more  than 36 percent in 2014.  ""As we're seeing costs and price point for solar systems fall, we're seeing concomitant increase in deal structures and investment  vehicles available to individual investors and utilities,"" said  Nadav Enbar, senior project manager in power delivery utilization  at the Electric Power Research Institute. ""As a result of this  maturity, investors consider renewable energy/solar as a potential  area with less risk for their dollars.""  Solar securities are still largely unproven, and the relatively  short tenure of solar projects–less than 20 years in many  instances–may become a barrier to wider adoption of solar  financing.  Still, the move toward tapping capital markets means green  projects could make the sector less vulnerable to the backlash  that often ensues from using public funds. Private investors are  starting to warm to the idea: US Bank has a alternative energy  arm that has doled out more than $1.7 billion to a spate of  renewable projects in the U.S.  A steep drop in solar prices and costs—data from the Solar  Energy Industries Association says sun-power is now 60 percent  cheaper than it was just a few short years ago—is fueling  strong demand.   According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), growth  in renewable power generation is expected to exceed 858 billion  kilowatt hours by 2040, with a bulk of that growth coming from  solar. Renewables generated 524 billion kilowatt hours in  2011.  Because solar power can be generated at the local level, and  because its infrastructure can be built easily without the  politically-tinged problems that accompany crude, it makes for a  comparatively attractive investment.

While famed investor Seth Klarman has recently turned bearish, warning of a potentially  catastrophic asset price bubble, Bogle thinks investors will be better off steeling their nerves and diversifying, rather than trying to time the market.  This is ""risky territory,"" and Klarman is ""heck of a lot  smarter than I am,"" Bogle said.

(Watch: Robert Schiller: We have a bubble)  But stock markets move in ""fits and starts,"" and the fundamentals  underneath stocks are solid.

2014-04-23,Euro zone business activity nears 3-year peak,0.11255425685425686,"A nascent recovery in euro zone business activity continued on  Wednesday with data managing to beat analysts' expectations,  despite slower growth in France and fears of falling prices  weighing on sentiment.  Markit's flash purchasing managers' index (PMI) for April  revealed that the euro zone's composite index rose to 54.0, up  from 53.1 in March. A reading above 50 marks an expansion in the  private sector.  The data was driven by strong growth in Germany, with the  composite number rising to 56.3 in April, from 54.3 in March.  France saw slower growth in its private sector, but output rose  for a second month with a figure of 50.5, down from March's 51.8  reading. Output in the euro zone's second-largest economy was hit  by new orders in manufacturing, which stagnated after rising in  March. This caused French firms to once again cut back on their  staffing levels, according to Markit, the London-based research  company that collates the data.  The data provided proof that French growth was still ""fragile"", according to Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight. This was in marked contrast to the ""robust"" expansion he suggested the German numbers indicated. Markit Tweet  The single currency rose to a session high of $1.3843 shortly  after the data release. The euro had started the session at $1.3806. European stock markets showed little change with earnings  release in the tech sector continuing to weigh on investor  sentiment.  Despite the softer data from France, the private sector in the  euro area grew at its fastest in just under three years in April,  with the bloc as a whole showing signs of a return to job  creation.  ""With backlogs of work rising, albeit only modestly, firms took  on more staff in order to expand capacity. The increase in  employment was the largest since September 2011, and only the  second since 2011. Rates of job creation in both the  manufacturing and service sectors were nevertheless only modest  as many firms continued to focus on keeping costs low to boost  competitiveness,"" the company said in Wednesday's release. Read MoreQE from ECB? May not be the panacea  many hope   Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist added that these PMIs  mean that GDP (gross domestic product) for the euro zone is on  course to rise by 0.5 percent in the second quarter, building on  a 0.4 percent rise in the first quarter.  ""Perhaps the best news came from the rest of the region, where  the fastest rate of growth seen since early-2011 suggests that  the recovery in the 'periphery' is gaining traction,"" he said.  As well as the worse-than-expected French data, Williamson said the outlook for prices is a concern. The euro bloc has  recently posted some weak growth in consumer prices and market  watchers have warned against the threat of dwindling inflation  and the possibility of deflation - where consumer prices start to  fall.Read MorePortugal set for    bond auction, first since bailout  The European Central Bank (ECB) has said that it is monitoring  the situation and has hinted that it would be ready to act if  this weakness continued. Williamson said that Markit's data  showed prices falling at their fastest pace since last August  despite the upturn in activity.  ""There will be growing fears that deflationary pressures are  intensifying and that the ECB needs to respond with more than  just words to the recent appreciation of the exchange rate,"" he  said."
2014-04-24,Mobile addiction growing at an alarming rate,0.09384766027623172,"Mobile addicts are multiplying at an alarming rate, as an  increasing number of teens, college students and middle-age  parents fall victim to the problem.  A ""mobile addict"" is defined as a user that launches apps more  than 60 times a day, according to mobile analytics firm Flurry,  six times more than the average user.  The number of mobile addicts has grown by 123 percent over the  past year, according to Flurry, which looks at data from 500,000  apps across 1.3 billion mobile devices.  As of March 2014, there were 176 million addicts, up from 79  million in the same period last year. Females accounted for 52  percent of addicts, while the rest were males.  It comes as no surprise that teens and college students are part  of this group as their youth has coincided with the mobile  revolution. Read More5 ways to kick your 24/7 tech  addiction  ""[Teens] are not just accustomed to mobile, they expect their  mobile device to handle nearly every type of task and  communication,"" Flurry said.  ""The same is true for college students who are noticeably avid  users of messaging and gaming apps. They have just entered the  workforce, are predominantly single and are likely out and about  more often than older and younger segments,"" it added.  What's interesting is the number of middle-aged consumers (aged  35-54) that have exhibited obsessive-compulsive behavior with  their mobile devices.  Middle-aged consumers constitute 28 percent of mobile addicts,  but account for just 20 percent of the average mobile consumer.  Female middle-aged addicts fell into categories such as mothers,  gamers and sports fans. Meanwhile, male addicts were parents, car  enthusiasts, gamers and catalog shoppers. Read MoreInstagram passes Twitter in race for US  smartphone users  Researchers, however, noted that part of the high usage amongst  middle-aged users could be because their devices are shared among  multiple family members including their children.  ""The picture we formed is a family of four, with two phones, one  tablet, and all three devices shared by the family for education,  entertainment and more utilitarian functions as well,"" Flurry  said.  Gadget addiction – or nomophobia – has become a growing  concern in Asia-Pacific, the region that is leading mobile phone  sales growth globally.   In the ultra-wired South  Korea, where the average smartphone owner spends over four hours  a day on the device,  the government is looking to take matters into its own hands by  possibly introducing a curfew on smartphone use, according to GlobalPost.    Three years ago, the government implemented a curfew to block  users under 16 years old from accessing online computer games  after midnight  in an  effort to curb video game addition among the youth.   Early adopters of wearable devices  With mobile addicts launching apps over 60 times a day, they are  effectively wearing the devices.  To date, most applications for wearables have focused on fitness  and health. But, developers should think about the other  experiences that will appeal to the people who need to be  connected all the time, Flurry said. Read MoreTablets are the new  smartphones  ""This includes teens, college students and middle-aged parents  who are interested gaming, autos, sports and shopping, and who  may have a constant need to entertain or educate their children.  After all, the people who we consider ""mobile addicts"" are  already essentially wearing their devices 24/7/365,"" it said."
2014-05-08,Ukraine rebels ignore Putin call to delay self-rule vote,0.03862572612572613,"Pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine ignored a public call by Russian President Vladimir Putin  to postpone a referendum on self-rule, declaring they would go ahead on Sunday  with a vote that could lead to war.The decision,which contradicted the  conciliatory tone set by Putin just a day earlier, caused consternation in the West, which fears the  referendum will tear Ukraine apart.U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns  said Russia was heading down a ""dangerous and irresponsible path"" and the situation in Ukraine  was ""extremely combustible"".Denis Pushilin, a leader of the self-declared  separatist Donetsk People's Republic, expressed gratitude to Putin but said the ""People's  Council"" had voted unanimously on Thursday to hold the plebiscite as planned.  ""Civil war has already begun,"" he told reporters. ""The referendum  can put a stop to it and start a political process."" A man  holding a Kalashnikov stood behind him.  The announcement coincided with a sharp change of tone from  Moscow, which had signalled a pullback from confrontation on  Wednesday with Putin's call for the vote to be delayed and a  declaration that troops were withdrawing from Ukraine's  border.  Russian markets sank after surging on Wednesday. In Kiev,  officials promised to press on with their ""anti-terrorist  campaign"" to retake control over the eastern regions of  Donetsk and Luhansk regardless of the rebels' decision on  the vote.  Political analysts said Putin may have expected the rebels to go  ahead with the referendum, showing that they were not under  his orders. By distancing himself from a process that will  not be recognised by the West, Putin may also hope to avoid  further sanctions as earlier measures begin hitting the economy.  Putin's spokesman said the Kremlin needed more information about  the rebels' decision. He said the rebel statement came only  after the Western-backed government in Kiev had declared it  would press on with its military operation, implying that  Ukraine was to blame for the rebels' refusal to heed Putin.  NATO and the United States have both said they have seen no sign  of a Russian withdrawal from the frontier despite Putin's  announcement he had pulled back troops.  When NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasumussen tweeted as  much, the Russian Foreign Ministry tweeted back that ""those  with a blind eye"" should read Putin's statement.  NATO has accused Moscow of using special forces in the separatist  takeover of mainly Russian speaking eastern Ukraine after  annexing Crimea from Ukraine in March.   Putin acknowledged his troops were active in Crimea after  initially denying any role there but says they are not  involved in eastern Ukraine, a densely-populated steel and  coal belt responsible for roughly a third of Ukraine's  industrial output. Read MoreMeet the beneficiaries of the crisis in  Ukraine Kremlin script?  Putin's unexpected call to delay the referendum, followed so  quickly by the rebel decision to go ahead with it, have  complicated U.S.and European efforts to agree a common  policy that might lead to tighter economic sanctions  on Russia.   The European Union said shortly before the announcement that it  was waiting to see whether Putin's words would be followed  by deeds and that the plebiscite ""would have no democratic  legitimacy and could only further worsen the situation"".  At the same time, the Russian ambassador to Paris said Putin, who  had been shunned by Western leaders since the Crimean  takeover, would join them in a ceremony to mark the 70th  anniversary of the Normandy landings in World War Two.  A Western diplomat in Moscow gave voice to the view that events  were still being scripted by the Kremlin.  ""Taking everything into account, I am somewhat surprised with  the separatists' decision. Wasn't Putin supposed to be like  the pope with his dogmatic infallibility?"" the diplomat  said.  The referendum has become seen as a vital step by many in  Ukraine's industrial east, fired up over what the rebels,  and Moscow, call the ""fascist"" government in Kiev that took  over after street protests ousted a pro-Moscow president in  February.  ""You have no idea how many armed people there are in Donetsk  right now,"" Roman Lyagin, the 33-year-old head of the  self-proclaimed republic's election commission, told Reuters  at his headquarters behind barricades of tyres and  car bumpers in the occupied regional administration in  Donetsk. ""There is no man who can move this referendum,"" he  said.  Ballots, printed in Donetsk, have been distributed across the  rebel zone, smuggled through Ukrainian army checkpoints.  Lyagin says more than three million people are eligible to  vote.  Artyom, a rebel at a roadblock in the rebel-held eastern town of  Slaviansk, said of the referendum decision: ""This is great  news. We need to have our say.""   While many Russian speakers in Ukraine fear discrimination under  the new leadership, quite how many support the separatists,  many of whom say their ultimate aim is to join Russia, is  not so clear. Recent opinion polls say a majority wish to  remain within Ukraine, but with a far greater degree  of autonomy.   Putin said his call for the vote's postponement would open the  way to negotiations on cooling down a crisis that has led to  dozens of deaths in clashes between troops and separatists  in eastern Ukraine and rival groups in the southern port of  Odessa. Read MoreAs Ukraine crisis deepens, risk-off  mood grows  On Thursday he again pointed the finger at Kiev,  whose ""irresponsible politics"" had caused the crisis.  Maria Lipman, an expert at the Carnegie Center think-tank in  Moscow, said Putin would have known that his request for the  referendum to be postponed would be rebuffed.  ""But this can be used to show that the people in Ukraine's east  are not Russians, take no orders from Russia, that Russia  exercises no control over them because they only do what  they want to do,"" she said.  ""He has also distanced Russia from the referendum, which has a  completely unclear status and will not be recognised by the  West.""  In a further shift from reconciliation, Putin oversaw test  launches of military rockets during training exercises held  across Russia on Thursday, the day before celebrations of  the anniversary of its World War Two victory.  The West has accused Russia of using previous military exercises  to build up forces along the border with Ukraine after its  Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovich fled to Russia in  February.  In the rebel-stronghold of Slaviansk, target of a Ukrainian  military advance that began last week, self-declared mayor  Vyacheslav Ponomaryov said a new offensive by Kiev was  coming.  ""We have enough fighters, enough weapons, the support of the  people and we have our land,"" he said. ""God is with us."""
2014-05-12,Banks within Wal-Mart stores collecting high fees,0.08119047619047619,"Wal-Mart has a reputation for offering shoppers low  prices, but a report in The Wall Street Journal found  that the independent banks it houses inside its stores levy some  of the highest bank fees, largely as a result of overdraft charges.  After analyzing federal filings, the publication found that last  year, the five banks that have the largest presence in the  discounter's stores were among the top 10 domestic banks in  terms of income from fees as a percentage of deposits.  Those banks are Fort Sill National Bank, First Convenience Bank,  Academy Bank, Woodforest National Bank and City National Bank and  Trust Company.  Overdraft fees can be a big issue for people struggling financially, as accruing them over time makes it makes it difficult to get out of debt.

2014-05-13,The US jet fighter that can do it all—maybe,0.19608893999518998,"On a mile-long assembly line in Ft. Worth, Texas, Lockheed Martin  is putting together a jet fighter that no one can match. The  F-35 Joint Strike Fighter will be stealthier, smarter, more  capable, and more flexible than any aircraft ever built.   It better be. It's costing American taxpayers close to $1  billion. A month.""It is a flying computer,"" said Steve O'Bryan, vice president of the  F-35's integration and business development at Lockheed Martin.  ""Where technology goes, where software goes, the F-35 will be  flexible with it.""  That's important for an aircraft which the U.S. military and its  allies are counting on to be the backbone of air defenses for the  next half-century. Read MoreThis is what caused the LA air traffic system crashFor example, the F-35 currently isn't  configured to control another aircraft, such as an unmanned plane  that may fly in formation with it, since no UAV—unmanned aerial vehicle—has yet been created that can keep pace with the F-35. That will probably change over the next  quarter century, and, conceivably, the software could be easily  added. ""The future would bring you an F-35 operating UAVs,"" said  O'Bryan.  A lot is riding on the Joint Strike Fighter's success. A  hundred jets have been built so far, and they are being tested by  the military. The first combat-ready airplane is slated to be  delivered next year. Eventually there will be more than 2,400  flying for the U.S. military, with allies buying hundreds  more. However, the non-partisan Government Accountability Office  found that issues remain with some of the jet's software, a problem that could again delay the rollout of an aircraft  that has already dealt with an array of problems and seen its  original price tag double. Developing, buying, and maintaining  the F-35 program over the next half century will cost about $1  trillion, with a ""T.""Still, the military remains committed to the plane. ""They're still working on the software,"" said Lt. Col. Matt  Renbarger, who is test-flying the aircraft at Eglin Air Force  Base in Florida. ""Apple and IBM, when they build new computers,  have to work through software things when they start things up—we're working through the same issues on our end, too,"" he said.  ""I'm confident the entire team is going to be able to put  together a very good airplane.""   There are many firsts with the F-35. It will be the first fighter  jet made of composite material. It consolidates a seemingly  endless amount of information onto a couple of screens inside the  cockpit...or onto the pilot's visor inside a custom-fitted  helmet. In addition, external cameras around the jet can transmit  pictures onto the visor so that when a pilot looks down, it will  be as if he or she is looking right through the bottom of the  plane.Read MoreThe city that may be Ukraine's line in the sand""If the radar sees something, the electronic warfare  system sees something, your wingman sees something in his  airplane, all of that stuff gets poured in, and you look on your  display, and you just have one picture of the battlespace,"" said  former F-35 test pilot Art Tomassetti, who now helps manage the  program at Lockheed.   That's a lot of information for one pilot to process, and as much  as the aircraft of the future is changing, so are the skills  needed in pilots.   ""The stick and rudder skills that used to be so important, we've  minimized, because we've made the airplane easy to fly,"" said  Tomassetti. ""What if we could teach anybody to fly the airplane?  Think about the spectrum (of pilots) that might open up for us.""  The best pilots in 25 years, he said, will be the best  tacticians.  ""We've trained 50 pilots here over the last year, and everyone  has said it's the easiest airplane they've ever flown,"" said Lt.  Col. Renbarger, who used to fly F-16s. Read MoreWith so much data  streaming in from so many sources, what's the risk of information overload?  ""We did have some concerns about that when we first started  flying the jet, but once we got into it and saw how much human  factors engineering had been put into the airplane, those  concerns have been allayed."" He added, ""All I have to worry about  is putting the cursors on something I want to shoot a missile at  or drop a bomb on...and it works.""Perhaps that's why the biggest threat to the best jet fighter  ever conceived isn't a Chinese warplane or a Russian missile—the  biggest threat could be far more potent: the budget ax. The  Pentagon is insisting Lockheed bring down the F-35's costs. and  there has been some progress on that front. For example, all three variations  of the jet are being built along the same assembly line in Ft.  Worth, which saves money. Read More""We also shrink the amount of time it  takes to build an F-35,"" said Steve O'Bryan. ""We only use about  15 percent of the labor force it took to build that same number  of F-16s.""   The F-35 has also created another trend we may see more of in 25  years: Bringing in international partners from the beginning to  help share the costs. Ten countries have invested in and/or  plan to buy the fighter.   Other trends include the ability of planes like the F-35 to carry  more bombs, but smaller, lighter bombs, which allow planes to fly  further and hit more targets. The entire military is also pushing  defense companies to build products that can operate on a single  software platform.   O'Bryan said the air defense system of the future will include  fewer single-mission aircraft—planes that really only have  one job—in favor of aircraft with multiple roles. ""Ninety  percent of every aircraft's lifetime is peacetime, and it also  has to contribute in that time as well, whether it be  intelligence-gathering or surveillance.""   It's a big shift from when he started flying F-18s a quarter  century ago.  Read More  ""When I flew, it was 'speed is life,'"" said O'Bryan. ""In today's  fifth generation (aircraft), it's 'information is life.'""   He said the old days of aerial dogfighting are over. If an F-35  pilot is ever actually seen by an enemy, he or she has done  something wrong. There's no need to ever get that close.   ""It's probably less romantic,"" O'Bryan said, ""but I never met a  fighter pilot who wanted a fair fight."" Read MoreMeet the man with the Pentagon  checkbook  Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated  that the F-35 is the only active fighter line in production in  the United States. In fact, Boeing still produces F/A-18s and F-15  fighters in St. Louis, Missouri."

Divorce settlements in England are seen as particularly generous  to ex-wives, because judges recognize the equal contributions  made by the breadwinner and the homemaker in a marriage, and  divide the assets equally.  Moreover, courts are increasingly having to deal with legal  battles brought by one side claiming the other has not made full  disclosure of assets and has concealed wealth. Read MoreMarc Andreessen in bitcoin for  the long run  Ayesha Vardag, a London divorce lawyer, has warned that more  lawyers may start including digital currencies in financial  disclosure orders if there is evidence they have been used.

Already, a number of forums devoted to Bitcoin discussion have  seen husbands exploring the option of using digital currencies,  she said.Read MoreDish to becomelargest company to accept bitcoin  Bitcoins provide relative anonymity to investors and, unlike bank  accounts and share holdings, they are hard to link to an  individual.  For this reason, the currency has become a mainstay of illicit  transactions, such as through Silk Road, the now-closed online  drugs and weapons marketplace.  Although traditional currency holdings – in US dollars or  euros for example – might need to be declared as part of the  asset disclosure process, parties could try to hide their wealth  by converting it to Bitcoins.  Unscrupulous spouses could also transfer the currency quickly and  almost anonymously between online wallets, hiding their wealth in  the hands of friends, perhaps outside of the jurisdiction, to  avoid discovery and enforcement.

2014-06-12,"Gundlach: Gold is going to $1,500",-0.02504528985507247,"It's one thing to say gold is going higher. But, when Jeffrey  Gundlach, manager of the $49 billion DoubleLine, says he thinks  gold will hit $1,500 per ounce by the end of this year, that's  something people pay attention to.  In a webcasted presentation called ""Penny For Your Thoughts"",  Gundalch noted the 96 percent reduction in the U.S. dollar's  purchasing power since the Federal Reserve Bank was established a  century ago, likening the end of the gold standard to the silver  debasement of the Roman denarius from 64 to 270 AD. During the  question and answer period, Gundlach said he thought gold could  move to $1,500 this year.  The last time gold was at $1,500 was in April, 2013. Gold traded  at $1,260 per ounce on Wednesday.  (Watch: Stocks slide; worst hit in 3  weeks for Dow, S&P 500)  ""Of course, there's a chance [Gundlach] could be right and gold  could go higher,"" said Richard Ross, global technical strategist  at Auerbach Grayson. ""But, there's very little in the short-term  technicals to suggest that move has begun in earnest.""  Gold has been trading in a range between $1,180 and $1,400 for  much of the past year, notes Ross. For the short-term, he is  keeping an eye on the $1,270 line, which is close to the current  150-day moving average. ""A break back above that level could set  us up for a retest of that resistance around 1,400,"" said Ross.  However, that range should be seen in the context of the  longer-term chart, according to Ross, a ""Talking Numbers""  contributor. ""We're still in a downtrend from the highs that we  established back around 1,900,"" he said.  Ross sees gold's break below its 150-week moving average as  technically significant. Since the start of 2013, the 150-week  moving average has been relatively flat, near the $1,525 level.  ""You've got to get through 1,400 before you can trade 1,500,  clearly,"" said Ross. ""And, in the shorter term, you've got  through 1,270 before you can trade 1,400. So, there's a lot of  ifs and buts here in that argument. We really need to see a base  breakout before we can call this a base.""  Gina Sanchez, founder of Chantico Global, said that while there's  a possibility that gold could go higher, she thinks the chances  are low. The World Bank's reduction of global growth from 3.2  percent to 2.8 percent may cause some flight-to-safety buying of  bullion. And, global interest rates are low, which traditionally  augurs well for the yellow metal. But, Sanchez believes that  won't last.  (Watch: World Bank: 'Now is the time  to prepare for next crisis')  ""Even though we're in a benign interest rate environment in the  U.S. – and certainly within Europe and Japan – I do  think that in the U.S., rates will likely start to trend higher  by the end of the year or into 2015,"" said Sanchez, a CNBC  contributor. ""That's not great for gold. We don't see a ton of  inflation. If anything, maybe there's some deflationary  pressures, particularly in Europe.""  Gold needs to feed on something, said Sanchez, but she doesn't  see a lot of major economic pessimism or inflation worries.  ""I'm not sure that I see why gold, except for some short-term  reasons, might pop a little,"" added Sanchez.

2014-07-03,Chipmaker Ambarella gets bump from GoPro,0.0861788617886179,"Chipmaker Ambarella may be  small relative to its competitors, but the company is attracting  more interest due to a surging stock and a few high-profile  clients.   The company makes chips that process high-quality video for a  variety of companies including camera maker GoPro—whose stock has surged since going public last week—and search giant Google. It's still small—its market  cap is about $900 million—but the stock has soared more than  95 percent in the past 12 months as investors cheered its growth prospects.   Fermi Wang, the company's CEO, says he first met GoPro founder  and CEO Nick Woodman five years ago at the Consumer Electronics  Show.  ""Since then, we have been working together closely with the GoPro  team on all of their camera products,"" Wang tells CNBC. Wang  founded Ambarella in 2004, and the company went public in  2012.   Kevin Cassidy at Stifel Nicolaus, who covers Ambarella, estimates  that GoPro now represents about 25 percent of the company's  business.  On Google wearables, Cassidy says Ambarella won a contract to be  part of Google's ""Helpouts"" services, which include a customer  service person helping with fixing your car, or taking Yoga or  Piano lessons through a small video camera linked to a Wi-Fi or  Bluetooth network. Read MoreCramer: GoPro stock is in a ""sweet  spot""  The main driver for Ambarella's business, however, is the  security and surveillance market, said Wang. Clients such as FLIR  Systems and leading surveillance equipment suppliers like  Hikvision rely on Ambarella's technology.IP security cameras constitute 45 percent of its business,  and that segment—which is growing 25 percent year-over-year—is ""a  bigger growth engine than GoPro,"" Cassidy said. Axis Communications of Sweden  is its biggest customer, and it has some smaller clients in China,  he said. Dashboard cameras are for now a small part of its  business, but growing popularity in China and Eastern  Europe and the possibility that more auto manufacturers could begin installing them points to another potential big growth engine for the company, Cassidy said.Wang also believes there is opportunity in the growing market for drones, as  manufacturers increasingly look to equip these unmanned aerial  vehicles with miniature HD-quality cameras.Not everyone sees a completely rosy growth forecast for the company, though. After the stock's strong run, analysts at  Deutsche Bank now argue that much of the good news in this story  is already priced in. Plus, the entire semiconductor market has been on a tear lately, and some analysts believe that run is about over.Read MoreWhy semiconductor stocks may be ready for a fall  Also, the company specializes in a very competitive market, where  it has to go head-to-head with rivals such as Texas Instruments  and Xilinx. But other analysts such as Suji De Silva of Topeka Capital  Markets say Ambarella has competitive advantages, for example chips that are more power efficient than competitors.  Bulls on the stock are also fans of Ambarella's management team.  Wang boasts a strong background in semiconductor design, and he  has already founded and sold one company called Afara  Websystems.   So is Ambarella an acquisition target? Cassidy thinks that tech  giants or other chip companies could be interested in buying the  company.  Cassidy says that the Wang and his partner have sold two other  companies and he sees Ambarella as a ""possible acquisition  candidate.""  ""Qualcomm, Nvidia or Intel are possible candidates, and I wouldn't  rule out Google or Facebook,  either,"" he said  A representative for Ambarella did not  respond to requests for comment on whether they'd be willing to  be acquired.—By CNBC's Mark Berniker and Josh Lipton.

2014-08-25,Why this winning sector may be a bad idea,0.14806829225196574,"One of the best performing sectors in the market last week may  not be the best investing idea.  The S&P 500's financial sector showed a 2.3 percent gain last  week. But according to Ari Wald, head of technical analysis, only  certain types of financial companies are worth buying. That is  why he's not keen on the ETF that tracks the financial sector as  a whole (trading under the ticker symbol XLF).  ""I like financials selectively, but I don't think the XLF is the  best way to play it,"" Wald said.  Though the XLF broke above a key resistance level last week and  made new highs, Wald believes there are some signals the recent  rally is not all in the sector as a whole.   (Read: )  ""Only a net 17 stocks of the 84 that are in the sector made a new  52-week high with it,"" Waldsaid. ""So it's a very selective move,  not broadlybased. A little bit of a closer look will show that  the capital markets industry and the REITs industry were the big  drivers of this trend. These are the industries that we want to  buy.""  Wald, however, is worried about the banks. ""I think XLF has too  much exposure to the banks,"" he said. ""I would rather be a little  more selective and concentrate on the industries rather than the  sector.""  Gina Sanchez, founder of Chantico Global, is on the same page as  Wald when it comes to the XLF's exposure to banks.  (Read: Citigroup facing restrictions  on sales of hedge fund investments: Report)  Banks make up about 36 percent of the XLF's holdings. ""That's a  huge driver of how it will do,"" said Sanchez, a CNBC contributor.  ""To the extent that we don't have a constructive view on banks,  it's hard to get really excited about the XLF.""  Though banks have had good earnings results in the second quarter  of 2014, Sanchez thinks that already has been priced into the  stocks.  ""Performance has really been bid up over the last several  months,"" Sanchez said. ""At this point you're looking for even  more performance than they've already given, and I'm not sure  that's possible.

2014-08-26,CSI Mad Money: Cramer's 5 stocks left for dead,0.03752205838143339,"Sure you've heard about those CSI shows on other networks. But at ""Mad Money,"" CSI stands for Cramer's stock investigation.""This is where we do an in-depth analysis of groups that have  been left for dead by the market,"" said Jim Cramer dressed  suspiciously like Nick Stokes.As we first discover Cramer, he's in his lab, err office, closely  examining the flesh and bones of five familiar names: DSW, Sears,  Lands' End, Abercrombie & Fitch and Ann Taylor.  ""These are all stocks that, at some point this year, were  brutally slaughtered. But that's where the similarity ends. Some of these retailers are knocking on death's door, while  others are bouncing back to life with a vengeance."" Cramer said.Following is Cramer's analysis: DSW   For DSW shareholders, the crime occurred at the end of May when  the shoe seller reported a disappointing quarter and shares fell  from $32 down to $23 in a single session.    ""Pretty much everybody bailed on DSW after that, Cramer  said. But last month I told you DSW was merely the victim of  transient fashion issues and bad weather and that a comeback was  on the way.  Sure enough, when   last night, it blew away the numbers, beating Wall Street's sales  and earnings forecasts and raising its full-year  guidance."" In turn, shares march sharply higher, gaining about 10  percent in a single session. ""No autopsy needed here."" added  Cramer with a sly smile, ""except for those poor short sellers who are now in a  world of hurt."" Sears  Going into the quarter, Cramer said Sears didn't have much of a  pulse. ""Then, the final blow was delivered last Thursday when the  company reported a larger than expected loss and missed the  estimates across the board, sending the stock down 7 percent in  one day.""  Looking at the metrics, there appear to be few signs of health.  ""This was the company's sixth consecutive , and  they lost twice as much money as they did a year ago. And  Sears is not just earnings challenged, it's sales challenged,  too; its revenues were down 10 percent year over year."" To make matters all the more concerning, the company reported a cash balance of $824  million. ""That may seem like a big improvement from the $671  million it had a year earlier, however, Sears spun-off its Lands'  End business earlier this year, giving them a one-time windfall  of $515 million.  And Sears can only do that once.   Back out that money, and the company would only have $314  million of cash, which is a pretty bleak."" All told, Sears has seen healthier days.   ""Put it all together, and you've got a retailer that just has too  many problems. The stock is still a 'sell' even down here at just  a couple points above its 52-week low,"" Cramer said Lands' End  Once a feared goner, Cramer says Lands' End may be the  proverbial victim who escaped the clutches of its captor. Well,  that may be a little dramatic, but Cramer did say Lands' End  looks much better now that it's wriggled free from Sears, which  used to own the company.  ""For years, Lands' End was stuck inside the Sears empire, passing  along its profits and unable to control its own destiny.   Now that it's been spun off as an independent company, I  think it has a bright future. In its first quarter out of the  gate, Lands' End delivered some excellent numbers, including a 48  percent jump in earnings per share.  Lands' End now has the  freedom and the resources to pursue faster growth, and its stock  is cheap, trading at 15 times next year's earnings estimates.   In the end, I think it's a survivor, one that's worth  buying here."" Abercrombie & Fitch  Cramer sees Abercrombie & Fitch as akin to the near-death  character rising from the grave (and probably scantily clad  too!)    ""Inventory levels are starting to stabilize and Abercrombie,  along with rivals, are closing stores which reduces supply,"" Cramer said. That bodes  well. ""While Abercrombie just made a new 52-week high on Tuesday,  it's still more than 30 points off its post great recession peak  in 2011, and I think it could have a lot more  upside.""  --------------------------------------------------------------  Read more from Mad Money with Jim Cramer 5 stocks give Cramer indigestion CEO: Stock decline buying opportunity Pharma firm with room to  run--------------------------------------------------------------  Ann Taylor  Ann Taylor may be like the victim who was rescued at the last  minute, by two watchful strangers. However, in this case the  strangers are Engine Capital and Red Alder, two large  shareholders who have urged the board of ANN to, including selling itself, in order to unlock value.  ""Over and over again this year we've seen activist investors push  all sorts of companies to create value for their shareholders, so  I'm intrigued by this situation, especially since the potential  activists at Engine Capital believe ANN could be worth $50 to $55  a share, as much as 31 percent higher than where the stock's  currently trading,"" Cramer said.   ""Ann has historically been a pretty strong operator, and if  the company doesn't want to sell itself, it has plenty of other  options.  For example, Ann has a pristine balance sheet, so  it could easily borrow a ton of money at very low rates in order  to finance a gigantic buyback.  Just a lot that could go  right here, although given the run-up over the last two days, I  think you should wait for a pullback before you pull the trigger  on this one.""(Click for video of this Mad Money segment)Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC  Questions for Cramer? madmoney@cnbc.com   Questions, comments, suggestions for the ""Mad Money"" website?  madcap@cnbc.com"

Kiev and its Western backers accuse Moscow of sending troops and  tanks into eastern Ukraine in support of pro-Russian separatists  battling Ukrainian forces in a conflict that has killed more than  3,000 people. Russia denies the accusations.   A fragile ceasefire negotiated by envoys from Ukraine, Russia,  the separatists and Europe's OSCE security watchdog, has been in  place in eastern Ukraine for more than a week and is broadly  holding despite sporadic violations.   ""We are still in a stage of war and the key aggressor is the  Russian\ Federation ...

There is no prospect of the Atlantic alliance admitting Ukraine,  a sprawling country of 45 million people between central Europe  and Russia, but Kiev has stepped up cooperation with NATO in a  range of areas and has pressed member states to sell it weapons  to help defeat the separatists.

Western powers imposed new sanctions on Friday, tightening  financial measures against Moscow in a move Putin called ""a bit  strange"" in view of the ceasefire.   Yatseniuk defended his government's efforts, despite the  conflict, to tackle rampant corruption and overhaul the creaking  economy, adding: ""It is very hard to attract investors when you  have Russian tanks and artillery in your country.""   Yatseniuk, whose centre-right People's Front party is expected to  do well in a parliamentary election on Oct. 26, praised a  decision on Friday to delay the implementation of a new trade  pact with the European Union until the end of 2015.

2014-10-02,JPMorgan Discovers Further Cyber Security Issues,0.10338250930356194,"For the second time in roughly three  months, JPMorgan Chase is  scrambling to contain the fallout from a security breach of its  vast computer network, according to several people with knowledge  of the investigation. JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, recently found that  hackers, with links to Italy or southern Europe, had gained entry  to some of the bank's servers, these people said. Read MoreJPMorgan:We are not aware of a new cyberattack The discovery follows an attack that was uncovered in late  July and suggests that it was more extensive than first thought.  In that attack, hackers obtained entry to dozens of the bank's  servers and reviewed information on more than one million  customer accounts. Security experts briefed on the matter had  said that the full extent of the July attack was not known and  that it could take the bank months to discover all of the  fallout.  ""We are not aware of any new attack,"" Kristin Lemkau, a  spokeswoman for JPMorgan, said. Any report that there was a  second breach is false, she added.  It is unclear whether the latest discovery constitutes a second  breach or is part of broader fallout from the first incident. The  revelation illustrates the challenges for JPMorgan as the bank  tries to secure all its systems against another threat. More from The New  York TImes: Pimco says rush of funds may be  slowing Loan fraud inquiry said to focus on used-car  dealers Senior Justice Dept. prosecutor to step  down  The original hack sent ripples through the financial system and  prompted an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, even as Wall Street,  which has been a frequent target for hackers in recent years,  worked to guard against the threats.  The bank was also forced to update its regulators, including the  Federal Reserve, on the extent of the breach. The bank said at  the time that there was no indication that any customer money was  taken and that it believed it had secured all its systems.  On Thursday, the bank's top executives, including Gordon A.  Smith, who heads JPMorgan's community and consumer banking, were  working to assess the extent of the latest attack, according to  two bank executives. NYT Correction: October 2,  2014  An earlier version of the headline with this article  misstated the extent of the cyber security issues at JPMorgan  Chase.

2014-10-06,Ebola could reach France and UK by end of October: Scientists,0.05907005596029988,"Scientists have used Ebola disease spread patterns and airline  traffic data to predict a 75 percent chance the virus could be  imported to France by October 24, and a 50 percent chance it  could hit Britain by that date.   Those numbers are based on air traffic remaining at full  capacity. Assuming an 80 percent reduction in travel to reflect  that many airlines are halting flights to affected regions,  France's risk is still 25 percent, and Britain's is 15  percent.   ""It's really a lottery,"" said Derek Gatherer of Britain's  Lancaster University, an expert in viruses who has been tracking  the epidemic - the worst Ebola outbreak in history. Read MoreEbola patient in Dallas 'fighting for his life' says CDC head  The deadly epidemic has killed more than 3,400 people since it  began in West Africa in March and has now started to spread  faster, infecting almost 7,200 people so far. Nigeria, Senegal  and now the United States - where the first case was diagnosed on  Tuesday in a man who flew in from Liberia - have all seen people  carrying the Ebola haemorrhagic fever virus, apparently  unwittingly, arrive on their shores.  France is among countries most likely to be hit next because the  worst affected countries include Guinea, alongside Sierra Leone  and Liberia, which is a French-speaking country and has busy  travel links back, while Britain's Heathrow airport is one of the  world's biggest travel hubs.   France and Britain have each treated one national who was brought  home with the disease and then cured. The scientists' study  suggests that more may bring it to Europe not knowing they are  infected.    ""If this thing continues to rage on in West Africa and indeed  gets worse, as some people have predicted, then it's only a  matter of time before one of these cases ends up on a plane to  Europe,"" said Gatherer.  Read MoreEbola patient in US takes turn  for the worse  Belgium has a 40 percent chance of seeing the disease arrive on  its territory, while Spain and Switzerland have lower risks of 14  percent each, according to the study first published in the  journal PLoS Current Outbreaks and now being regularly updated at  http://www.mobs-lab.org/ebola.html.   The World Health Organisation (WHO) has not placed any  restrictions on travel and has encouraged airlines to keep flying  to the worst-hit countries.  and Emirates airlines have suspended  some flights.  But the risks change every day the epidemic continues, said Alex  Vespignani, a professor at the Laboratory for the Modeling of  Biological and Socio-Technical Systems at Northeastern University  in Boston who led the research.   ""This is not a deterministic list, it's about probabilities - but  those probabilities are growing for everyone,"" Vespignani said in  a telephone interview. ""It's just a matter of who gets lucky and  who gets unlucky.""    The latest calculations used data from October 1. Read MoreDeadly Ebola virus spreads—and so do fears  ""Air traffic is the driver,"" Vespignani said. ""But there are also  differences in connections with the affected countries (Guinea,  Liberia and Sierra Leone), as well as different numbers of cases  in these three countries - so depending on that, the probability  numbers change.""  Patients unaware  Patients are at their most contagious when Ebola is in its  terminal stages, inducing both internal and external bleeding,  and profuse vomiting and diarrhoea - all of which contain high  concentrations of infectious virus.      But the disease can also have a long incubation period of up to  21 days, meaning that people can be unaware for weeks that they  are infected, and not feel or display any symptoms.    This, it seems, is what allowed the Liberian visitor Thomas Eric  Duncanto to fly to the United States and spend several days there  unaware that he was carrying the deadly virus, before being  diagnosed and isolated.  In the European Union, free movement of people means someone  unknowingly infected with Ebola could easily drive through  several neighbouring countries before feeling ill and seeking  help, and spend weeks in contact with friends or strangers before  becoming sick enough to show up on airport scanners.        Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at Britain's  Nottingham University said that even with exit screening at  airports of affected countries, the long, silent incubation  period meant ""cases can slip through the net"".

""Ebola virus isn't just an African  problem.""   However, the chance of the disease spreading widely or developing  into an epidemic in a wealthy, developed country is extremely  low, healthcare specialists say.   According to the latest Ebola risk assessment from the European  Centres of Disease Prevention and Control, which monitors health  and disease in the region, ""the capacity to detect and confirm  cases...is considered to be sufficient to interrupt any possible  local transmission of the disease early.""

""Even if we have a worse case scenario where someone doesn't  present for medical treatment, or..it's not correctly identified  as Ebola, and we get secondary transmission, it's not likely to  be a very long secondary transmission chain,"" he said.   ""People aren't living in very crowded conditions (in Europe), so  the disease doesn't have the same environment it has in a shanty  town in Monrovia, where the environment is perfect for it to  spread. It's a different matter in modern western cities with the  very sanitized, sterile lives that we live."""

2014-11-25,Health-care maze remains for undocumented immigrants,0.10067127799736494,"President Obama's executive order preventing the deportation of  up to 5 million undocumented immigrants won't preclude all of  them from getting affordable health coverage. But it remains to  be seen just how many will be presented with that option.   Even if a good amount do get insurance, the health, social  and economic costs from having the remaining immigrants  effectively locked out of health coverage will remain a problem,  say advocates and analysts.  And some of those  costs—including visits to  emergency rooms that aren't paid by  insurance—could end up getting  passed along to the general public, they noted.  Undocumented immigrants, who currently comprise one in every six  people in the United States without health insurance, by 2017 are  projected to make up 1 in 4 such uninsured people, said Stephen  Zuckerman, co-director of the Health Policy Center at the Urban  Institute.  Zuckerman noted that it's not because there will be more  undocumented immigrants without insurance. Instead, he said, it's because there will be significantly more  currently uninsured people overall getting insured in the coming  years through Obamacare insurance plans and from Medicaid,  particularly in states that have expanded eligibility for  Medicaid to include more people.  But both those options will essentially be blocked to the people  subject to Obama's order last week, which lifts the threat of  deportation and will give those people the ability to work  legally in the U.S. Read MoreCat got your tongue,  HealthCare.gov?  The White House has indicated it will not allow such  undocumented people access to federal subsidies that help most  Obamacare enrollees afford policies sold on government-run  insurance exchanges. And those people will also be barred by  federal law from enrolling in Medicaid, the joint  federal-state program that covers poor people.  ""This issue of health coverage has been separated from their  legal status and the ability to work,"" Zuckerman said. ""And  that's going to leave a large number of people without coverage,  and without the ability to get coverage either through Medicaid  or the subsidies in the marketplace.""  That decision to separate health coverage out of the equation  echoes a similar decision in 2013 by the Obama administration  when it deferred deportation for young undocumented immigrants  said they could not benefit from Obamacare subsidies, said  Shannon Erwin, state policy director at the Massachusetts  Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition.  ""It was a political decision, and not really a health  policy-informed decision,"" said Erwin, pointing out that the  Obamacare exchanges were due to launch later that same  year.   ""I would hope there would be an an opportunity to re-open that  conversation,"" said Erwin, who noted that health coverage is ""a  top concern"" among immigrants.  But Derrick Morgan, vice president for economic freedom and  opportunity of the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that  while, ""I think the administration would like"" to expand  subsidies to those affected people, it shouldn't do so.  ""The president promised that illegal immigrants would not receive  funding for Obamacare,"" Morgan said. The Heritage Foundation, he  said, opposes having undocumented workers receive health coverage  from government-sponsored or government-subsidized programs.  ""They're here unlawfully, and the American taxpayer and the  American citizens are the ones paying for these benefits, and  these subsidies should not be going to those that are here  illegally,"" Morgan said. Read MoreObama's immigration plan risks  backlash   That said, the people covered by Obamas order will have several  avenues for health coverage as they become eligible for work  permits.   ""More people will have jobs,"" noted Claudia Calhoon, senior  health specialist with with the New York Immigration Coalition.  ""They will have more financial stability because they no longer  will be in the shadows.""  With some of those job, people will be offered employer-sponsored  insurance, Calhoon said. They will also have the option of buying  unsubsidized individual insurance outside the Obamacare  exchanges, at the least, although Calhoon noted such  ""off-exchange"" plans can be much more expensive than the ones  sold on the exchanges.  ""It will be very important to get the word out to people so they  understand what benefits are available to them,"" she said. ""Educating immigrant communities about what options do  exist, and safety services for people who are uninsured, will be  important.  But it's not clear how many of the immigrants subject to Obama's  order will be able to buy—and able to afford—health  coverage through their jobs or in the individual health plans,  said Samatha Artiga, director of the Disparities Policy Project  at the Kaiser Family Foundation.  ""We do know, historically, that immigrants have been more likely  to have low-wage job and be in industries that do not provide  health-care coverage to workers,"" said Artiga.  And even if they are offered coverage through their employer, ""In  many cases, that's unaffordable,"" she said.  Artiga said Obama's order could alleviate the fears of being  deported that have kept some of the affected undocumented  immigrants from enrolling their U.S.-born children in Medicaid  and CHIP health insurance programs that those kids are eligible  for due to their citizenship status.  ""From past research and experience, that has always been a big  barrier for enrolling children in those mixed-status families,""  she said.   ""But I think the broader issue is that individuals remain without  access to affordable health coverage options, so many of them may  remain uninsured.""  But that doesn't mean they will stay out of the hospital.  Uninsured undocumented immigrants, along with other uninsured  Americans who visit the emergency room and get other hospital  services despite being unable to pay for their care, in 2012  generated nearly $46 billion in uncompensated care costs at 4,999  U.S. hospitals in 2012, the last year data was available,  according to the American Hospital Association.  Those costs, equal to 6.1 percent of total hospital expenses, end  up being covered by a federally funded program, by extra charges  to those with insurance, or by the hospitals themselves.  While the AHA doesn't have data on how much of those costs are  due to undocumented immigrants, they can be considerable in  individual cases.  Dr. Julia Koehler, a pediatrician at Boston Children's Hospital, told CNBC about how an undocumented  Brazilian immigrant had previously sought her help after incurring  a back injury he suffered while trying to lift an older, heavier  stranger who had slipped and fallen on some ice on a sidewalk.For more than two weeks the immigrant, a father of three,  had avoided going to the doctor because he lacked insurance, said  Koehler, a Harvard Medical School assistant professor who volunteers at a clinic that serves immigrants.  ""He ended up with an emergent injury to his spinal cord, which  was a prolapse of the disc into the spinal canal,"" Koehler said.  When he was properly diagnosed by ""an excellent neurosurgeon,""  Koehler said, the man was told he had more than a 50 percent risk  of paralysis.  ""He was going to lose control of his feet, his bladder and his  bowel, and not be able to work anymore because he didn't have  health insurance,"" Koehler said. Read MoreTech world needs high-skilled  foreigners: CEO   Fortunately, the man's surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital in  Boston was a success, and he made a full recovery, she said. But  the surgery itself cost ""tens of thousands of dollars,"" which he  was unable to pay, and which the hospital absorbed.  While the man's story has a happy ending, Koehler said in other  cases, breadwinner in immigrant families are hurt on the job or  get sick elsewhere, and then are left temporarily or permanently  unable to support their families, which can in turn lead to  health issues for them as well, and them becoming an economic  burden to hospitals and taxpayers.  Even an immigrant going without a flu shot because of lack of  insurance can lead to significant costs for others, she said.  ""If you don't have health insurance and you have low income, it  is very unlikely that you will come up with the money to buy a  flu shot,"" Koehler said. ""So the unimmunized person will then  possibly expose other vulnerable people, perhaps asthmatics,  young infants, older people.""  ""Health insurance should be available regardless of immigration  status, because, again, it goes beyond the health of the affected  individuals, and it goes to the health of the whole family and  the whole community,"" she said."

2014-12-03,Australia headed into perfect storm in 2015,-0.0026487093153759844,"Australia's economy will undergo a crucial stress test in 2015,  faced with a triple whammy from the lagged impact of plunging  commodity prices, sharp declines in mining investment and renewed  fiscal tightening, says Goldman Sachs.  ""The challenges are now widely known…but these challenges  still lie mainly ahead for Australia rather than behind,"" Tim  Toohey, chief economist, Australia at Goldman Sachs wrote in a  note on Wednesday.  On top of the these headwinds, the economy  also needs to contend with tighter financial conditions and lower  levels of housing investment, said Toohey, factors  that had previously helped to offset the slump in the mining sector.  The bank expects gross domestic product (GDP) growth to average  just 2.0 percent next year, down from an estimated 2.9 percent in  2014, as the economy continues to search for new growth drivers. Read MoreAustralia's economy slows in Q3  The decline in mining investment will continue to be a major drag  on the economy, leaving commodity exports and consumption to pick  up the slack, the bank said.  Australia's third quarter GDP data published on Wednesday pointed  to a sluggish domestic economy, suggesting rebalancing away from  mining-driven growth is taking longer than hoped.    The economy expanded 2.7 percent on year in the three months to  September, undershooting expectations for growth of 3.1 percent,  as construction spending fell while sliding export prices hit  incomes.  ""This GDP result concurs broadly with the perceived wisdom on the  Australian economy, albeit with perhaps a little more domestic  weakness than expected, said David de Garis, director and  senior economist at National Australia Bank.  ""Investment is weakening as major mining projects complete, while  an extended terms of trade fall is driving weakness in real  domestic income,"" de Garis said. RBA's next move  As Australia navigates a tricky rebalancing act, Goldman expects  the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to stand pat on monetary  policy until March 2016, when it forecasts the central bank will  commence raising interest rates.  The bank previously expected the RBA to hike rates by 25 basis  points in the fourth quarter of 2015. Read MoreAustralia holds rates as speculation  for cuts mounts  The central bank on Tuesday kept rates at a record-low 2.5  percent, and maintained its rhetoric for a period of stability  for rates.  However, some economists believe weak growth, slowing inflation  and a rising jobless rate could pressure the RBA to ease monetary  policy further.  Earlier this week, Deutsche Bank released a report titled  ""Australia: Change of Call,"" which predicts the RBA will cut  rates by 50 basis points to 2 percent next year, a shift from its  earlier stance of no change. Read MoreWhy RBA's move to cool housing could  backfire  In this environment, the beleaguered Australian dollar is  expected to remain on its downtrend.  Goldman expects the currency to fall to $0.86, $0.85 and $0.82 on  3, 6 and 12-month views, respectively, from $0.84 currently.  Meanwhile, the country's stock market is poised for moderate  gains.  The benchmark ASX-200, among the worst performing markets this  year, is forecast to rise 9 percent to 5,700 by end 2015,  according to the bank."

2015-03-25,'Easy money' has been made with Apple: Analyst,0.24909370199692785,"What's Apple really worth? At more than $700 billion, Apple is currently the world's most valuable company.

Based on Icahn's share valuation that he made in February, Apple would be a $1.3 trillion company.Morningstar senior analyst Brian Colello disagrees. ""You get cannibalization, I think you see the iPhone growing really well but the iPad is not and so if the Watch grows really well, maybe iPhone growth slows.

He  wrote in his research note that the 99 percent customer  satisfaction rate for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus keeps the devices as the most important, and lucrative, in Apple's expanding  product portfolio.The expanding portfolio of course includes the Apple Watch. ""We continue to view Apple Watch as a product category that will drive incremental revenue for Apple, but more important, will offer especially strong stickiness to the iOS ecosystem that will enable Apple to make repeat sales of high-margin iPhones to these customers over time,"" Colello wrote in his note.""The easy money's been made at this point.

""But in general when you look at the smartphone market, two, three years out, once all the China mobile customers get their hands on it, now you have the larger screen, it's harder to see a lot of growth.

2015-03-29,Greek PM Tsipras says he seeks no rift with Europe,0.016738816738816744,"Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said on Saturday that he  sought no rift with Europe after his cash-strapped country  submitted a list of reforms to its lenders in a bid to secure  much-needed funds.  Tsipras' leftist government agreed an extension to its  240-million euro bailout fund in February, albeit with aid  frozen, and now must agree on a set of reforms which it sent to  its EU-IMF creditors on Friday in order to stave off bankruptcy.  The austerity-weary nation will run out of money by April 20, a  source told Reuters on Tuesday, if it does not unlock much-needed  funding.  ""The liquidity problem is naturally hampering the situation but I  believe that will be tackled immediately once we reach an  agreement over reforms,"" Tsipras said in an interview with  Sunday's Real News newspaper.  After answering a question regarding government attempts to deal  with corruption, Tsipras was asked whether he wanted a rift or a  solution with Greece's partners: ""My view has always been the  same: a break from corruption, a solution with Europe.""Read More  Fitch downgrades Greece to 'CCC' from 'B'  Earlier Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, one of Tsipras'  most left-wing ministers, hit out at a ""Germanised European  Union.. for tightening week by week the noose around the Greek  economy.""  Athens says its reforms will boost state revenues by 3 billion  euros ($3.3 billion) in 2015, partly by tackling tax evasion, but  that it will oppose any new ""recessionary measures"" such as  further wage or pension cuts.  As talks unfold, Finance Minister Varoufakis told Vima newspaper  on Sunday that the reforms would not include a rise in VAT, which  had been a concern on Greece's islands where rates are lower, but  changes to tax collection would be made.  Varoufakis was the centre of speculation on Friday following a  report in the German newspaper Bild that a Greek government  source had said it was only a matter of time before he resigned.  But Tsipras said Varoufakis was ""one of the key members of the  government"". China and Russia  As Greece races to agree to raise funds, Deputy Prime Minister  Yannis Dragasakis told China's official Xinhua news agency that  Athens will sell its majority stake in the port of Piraeus within  weeks, a flip-flop from its previous position.  Speaking during a visit by Greek officials to China, Dragasakis  hinted that Chinese firm Costco Group - short-listed in a process  launched by the previous centre-right government - was a front  runner for the state's 67 percent stake.  And as Greece seeks to fill its state coffers, the Russian  ambassador to Athens told Kathimerini newspaper that Moscow would  examine any loan request from Greece, were it to be made.  Tsipras is due to visit Moscow on April 8 for talks with Russian  President Vladimir Putin but the Greek government has stressed it  is not seeking funding from the Kremlin.  On Saturday, Greece's energy ministry said Lafazanis will meet  Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak and Gazprom Chief  Executive Alexei Miller on Monday in the capital, a week before  Tsipras is due to arrive.  The previous centre-right government had planned to accelerate  the sale of a 65 percent stake in gas utility DEPA, after an  initial attempt to sell to Gazprom in 2013 failed. Within days of  Syriza taking power in January, Lafazanis said he would scrap the  sale.  DEPA has previously negotiated with Gazprom in a bid to get  cheaper gas supplies and was one of the first European companies  to obtain a rebate in 2011.  The two countries, which are both Orthodox Christian, have  traditionally had good relations and Athens has never strongly  supported sanctions against Russia over the conflict in Ukraine."
2015-04-13,Qualcomm should consider breakup: Jana Partners founder,0.07553391053391055,"Activist investor Jana Partners has held ""constructive  discussions"" with Qualcomm about potentially spinning off its chip  unit from its patent-licensing business, Jana founder and  managing partner Barry Rosenstein said on Monday.  ""We are convinced that the board and the management recognize  their issues. We are convinced that they're trying to do the  right thing, and we're optimistic that they're going to,"" he said  during an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street.""  Rosenstein emphasized that Jana is only asking Qualcomm to  consider a spinoff at this point.   ""What we think they ought to do is just a transparent review of  the client businesses, and determine whether or not it makes  sense to do either a partial or full split. So we are not  definitely saying that they should split it up,"" he said. Read MoreWhy rise of activist investors is bad  for bonds The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Jana had  addressed the possible split as a means of boosting the  chipmaker's sagging stock price, citing a quarterly letter that  will be sent to Jana investors on Monday.  Shares of Qualcomm, which has a market capitalization of $115.4  billion, have fallen about 6 percent since the beginning of this  year. The stock was trading nearly 1 percent higher on  Monday.  Jana, one of Qualcomm's largest shareholders, is also calling on  the company to cut costs, accelerate stock buybacks and make  changes to its executive pay structure, financial reporting and  board of directors, the newspaper said.  Qualcomm said last month it would buy back up to $15 billion of  shares and raise its quarterly dividend. The company also said it  would continue to return at least 75 percent of its free cash  flow to shareholders annually.  Rosenstein acknowledged that Qualcomm has already announced a $10  billion advanced share repurchase, but said he believed the  company could return an additional $5 billion within four to six  months.  In the letter, Jana said the buyback is a positive step but  Qualcomm needs to do more to capitalize on its strong position in  the chip market.

2015-05-11,Uber Funding Talks Highlight the Speedy Pace of Investments,0.1222071678321678,"Uber raised a total of more than $2 billion from investors in  June and December last year — and is now back for another  round. The anonymous messaging start-up Yik Yak collected $73.5  million in three financing rounds in seven months, and Zenefits,  a human resources start-up, raised more than $580 million in less  than two years, with the latest deal done last week.  The pace of technological change has long been happening at the  lightning-fast speed of the Internet. Now, start-up financing is  increasingly taking place at that speed as well.Read MoreUber's valuation may top $50B with new funding: WSJ  Uber is just one example of the quickening tempo. The  ride-hailing company is in discussions to raise around $1.5  billion in financing, which could value it at $50 billion. Just five months ago the company  collected$1.2 billion for its war chest, an amount that  later swelled with the addition of a strategic investor. And the rate of fund-raising by Uber — and across the  start-up landscape — has little precedent, driven by money  pouring in from hedge funds, strategic investors and more, and by  the willingness of entrepreneurs to embrace the cash.  ""When capital markets are this loose, people tap them, whether  it's right to or not,"" said Mark Suster, a partner at the venture  capital firm Upfront Ventures. ""Companies are raising rapid  rounds of capital for only one reason: They can.""  The frequency of the fund-raising by many start-ups — now  multiple rounds in months rather than years — is ""otherwise  unheard-of,"" said Anand Sanwal, chief executive of CB Insights, a  research firm that studies venture capital. More from The New York Times:An App That Helps Drivers Earn the Most From Their  Trips Uber Fund-Raising Points to $50 Billion  Valuation UberJoins the Bidding for Here, Nokia's Digital Mapping  Service  The shrinking time between funding rounds shows how Silicon  Valley's current boom is not just about start-ups reaching a high  valuation but also about how fast they can pull that off. The  tempo is in marked contrast to the pace of start-up fund-raising  last decade, when many companies would typically leave a year or  two between financing rounds. When LinkedIn, the professional  social networking company, raised money as a start-up in the  mid-2000s, it took more than three years for its first three  rounds of financing.  Since the beginning of 2013, however, more than 20 tech start-ups  have held three rounds of funding within a year and a half,  according to CB Insights, which called the group  the ""18-month sprint"" companies. Last  year, nearly 500 tech start-ups did financing rounds  less than one year apart, CB Insights estimated, more than any  other year since at least 2011.  Among the companies that completed numerous financings in tight  time frames was the fitness membership start-up ClassPass, which  completed three rounds in nine and a half months, CB Insights  said. Slack, the collaboration software start-up, last  month took in $160 million; just six months earlier, it had  received $120 million from investors. Snapchat in  December raised nearly half a billion dollars from a bevy of  financiers. Just three months later, the Chinese e-commerce  company Alibaba poured $200 million into the messaging start-up. Read MoreTravel hubs hitch a ride on Apple  Watch bandwagon  Spurring the more frequent fund-raising is the desire of  investors — including hedge funds, mutual funds and  strategic investors — to put up money more often for fear of  missing out on the next big thing. One reason Uber is in talks to  raise money again just a few months after a prior round is  because of an overwhelming amount of investor interest, said a  person with knowledge of the company who spoke on the condition  of anonymity because the process is confidential.  Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Many institutional funds and international companies have leapt  into start-up investing as the number of initial public offerings  has slowed, prompting investors to wade into private companies to  find growth, according to Mark A. Siegel, managing director at  the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, which has invested in  Uber.  ""I don't blame entrepreneurs,"" Mr. Siegel said. ""This is  something where investors are absolutely complicit in this, and  in some ways are driving this.""  He added that the phenomenon of fast fund-raising appears largely  limited to the club of ""unicorns,"" or the elite companies that  are worth at least $1 billion. Investments in the later financing  rounds for companies jumped to $4.2 billion in the first quarter,  up 50 percent from a year ago, according to data from the  National Venture Capital Association, making it the biggest  quarter for such investments since late 2000.  Entrepreneurs are often happy to take up eager investors on their  offers. Stewart Butterfield, chief executive of Slack, recently  said that his start-up had more than enough money in the bank  — just before collecting $160 million more.  ""This is the best time to raise money ever,"" he said last month.  ""It might be the best time for any kind of business, in any  industry, to raise money for all of history, like since the time  of the ancient Egyptians.""  Mr. Butterfield said Slack had ""no immediate use"" for the new  money it had just raised. Still, the capital ""reinforces the  perception for our larger customers that we'll be around for the  long haul,"" he said.  Parker Conrad, chief executive of Zenefits, said rapid-fire  fund-raising is necessary to quickly build up a company so it is  large enough to take on competitors. With the money, Zenefits has  been able to persuade more than 10,000 small and midsize  businesses to use its service.  ""We want to grow really big, really fast,"" Mr. Conrad said in an  interview last week for the company's third round of fund-raising since early 2014.  ""That requires a lot of capital.""  Even if the numerous rounds of new cash are not put to immediate  use, the money may come in handy one day if — or when —  the free-flowing capital faucets are shut off. Investors like  Bill Gurley, a partner at the venture capital firm Benchmark,  have warned of an eventual reckoning, a time when money  is not as easy to come by, which will cause some companies to  sputter out when their bank accounts empty. Read More  It is to protect against this inflection point that some  companies may be raising as frequently as they can, while they  can, said Mr. Suster of Upfront Ventures.  ""Some companies view these as war chests being raised to weather  the inevitable corrections,"" he said. ""For now, the tide is high  and nobody knows who's naked."""
2015-05-13,Dick Grasso: $4T question nobody is asking the Fed,0.12097902097902098,"With all the talk about when the Federal Reserve might increase interest rates, former New  York Stock Exchange chief Dick Grasso said Wednesday he's  concerned about how the central bank plans to reduce its $4.4  trillion balance sheet.  The question nobody seems to be asking the Fed, according to Grasso: ""How are you going to do  that in the context of everyone else in the world stimulating  [and] lowering rates—applying, if you will, the type of  stimulus we applied.""  The total assets of the Fed have increased  from about $869 billion in August 2007, during three rounds of  quantitative easing bond purchases  that started in November 2008 in an effort to support the economy  and combat the effects of the financial crisis.  Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke argued at an event last month  the central bank could maintain its balance sheet at somewhat  higher amounts than precrisis levels.

2015-06-20,Hedge fund manager Mark Spitznagel to advise Rand Paul,0.1036005661005661,"Mark Spitznagel, the libertarian hedge fund manager, has a  new part-time job: senior economic advisor  to  campaign for president.  Spitznagel is the founder and chief investment  officer of Universa Investments, a fund that  specializes in protecting investors against sharp market drops, sometimes referred to as Black Swan events. The firm manages about $6 billion in  assets, a sizable figure for the hedge fund industry. ""I am very grateful to have Mark Spitznagel serve as senior economic advisor to my campaign,"" Paul, now a U.S. senator from Kentucky, said in a statement. ""As I  travel across the country, the top concern of the American people  is our failing economy. I believe we can revitalize our economy  by encouraging opportunity and entrepreneurship with lower  taxes, a balanced budget, less Federal Reserve  interventionism, and limited government spending,"" the candidate said.""I  look forward to working alongside Mark to solve our nation's  economic problem and to restore the American Dream,"" he added. Paul, one of the leading contenders for the Republican party nomination, was elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010.

2015-07-04,Insurers choose their partners. So how big will the dance floor be?,0.14570620921367192,"Aetna  and Humana have announced a $35 billion  cash and stock agreement to merge, one day after Centene indicated it  planned to buy its Medicaid-focused rival Healthnet for $6.8  billion.   Should Anthem and Cigna eventually reach a deal to combine their  businesses, it will mark one of the most significant eras of  consolidation in the history of the health insurance  sector. Yet the question remains whether regulators will embrace  the deals as quickly as these rivals have embraced one another.  Four of the largest U.S. insurers will combine to form two health-care powerhouses, and the competition may spur more mergers among  smaller players. ""The effect is going to be very specific to markets,"" said  Christopher Koller, the president of the Milbank Memorial Fund, a  health policy research foundation that advises states. Read More""What the [Federal Trade Commission] will want to determine  is, does an insurer have a big enough market share in a  particular market so as to eliminate or reduce competition,""  asked Koller, who served as Rhode Island's health insurance  commissioner from 2006-2013.  Still, Koller argues that when it comes to insurance the bar has  been set fairly high by federal regulators.  ""I regulated a  market where a domestic, local, non-profit (Blue Cross plan) had  60-70 percent of market share. And I certainly didn't have the  FTC marching in there trying to take it apart,"" he said.  Yet current Rhode Island Health Insurance Commissioner Kathleen  Hittner said these new large insurer deals should be carefully  scrutinized because it could hurt the burgeoning consumer  market.  ""People want consolidation for efficiency, which is what  (insurers) promote,"" said Hittner. ""If you have competition, they  look at the other plans and they try to have similar plans,"" she  said.  ""I think if you take away that competition, we will see higher  rates and we will see less ability for the states to adjust those  rates,"" she added.With nearly 5 million members, Humana's dominant position in  Medicare plans is one of the factors that attracted Aetna to  purchase its smaller rival. If the deal is approved, the combined  firm would have greater than 50 percent market share in Medicare  in more than half a dozen states, according to a recent analysis  by Susquehanna Financial Group.   That would make one area where regulators may raise concerns,  which some analysts say could be solved by either company selling  off chunks of its business.   ""We expect the deal will close with divestitures in pockets  to address anti-trust scrutiny,"" wrote Ana Gupta, a health-care analyst at Leerink in a note to clients. Gupta raised her price  target on both Aetna and Humana following Friday's announcement.  However, she noted that regulatory approvals for the merger would  take time, as would expected cost savings.   ""The deal is expected to generate cost synergies of $1.25 billion in  2018 and estimated closing in second half of 2016,"" Gupte  wrote. Aetna's chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini said in a statement that  the combined company will be able to reduce overhead costs and  pass on better rates to their customers.      ""This combination will allow us to continue to invest in  excellent service for our members and strengthen our partnerships  with providers to deliver high quality care at an affordable  price,"" he added.  That may be easier said than done, advocates say, and is largely  dependent on how robustly regulators look at the deal's impact on  consumers.  ""Greater consolidation could lead to improved efficiencies,"" said  Elizabeth Imholz, director of special projects and advocacy at  Consumers Union, but only ""if we had a really effective rate  review and antitrust system in place that could look at the  antitrust considerations and also closely scrutinize rate  filings by insurance companies.""While the Affordable Care Act triggers government review  for rate increase requests of more than 10 percent, insurance  regulatory scrutiny at the state level varies widely, Imholz  said.  She hopes federal regulators will watch the proposed  deals closely.""I don't see how the FTC could look the other way if these  big insurer [deals] are proposed, because it's of great public  import,"" Imholz said. ""Even one big one would be important for  them to look at.""One of the arguments insurers make for consolidation is to  counter the wave of deal-making in the hospital and medical  provider sector, which has given some players tremendous  concentration and market power. Over the last 10 years, the number hospital deals have  outpaced insurance acquisitions by six to one on average,  according to data from S&P Capital IQ. Insurance industry consultant Robert Laszewski said he expected strong pushback from doctors and hospitals against the large  insurer mergers.     ""I think there'll be huge opposition from the provider  industry. I think that's what the analysts are missing,"" said  Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy  Associates.   ""There would be so much market clout gain that I think it would  concern people from a competition standpoint, and raise the ire  of the hospital and physician lobby,"" he added.   Consumers will want to be vocal, as well, said Imholz.  ""It is very dynamic out there in marketplace,"" she said. ""We have  to, from the consumer side, be vigilant about what's  happening."" (CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated Elizabeth Imholz's name.)"
2015-07-24,Cramer game plan—My great Fed-pectations in week ahead,-0.04063090693525476,"Just when Jim Cramer thought the market was done worrying about the  drama of foreign lands, suddenly China brought the focus right back to where  it was with Greece a few weeks ago.  ""Yes, the idea that there is big trouble in not-so-little China, based on some very weak Chinese factory orders and a stock  market that is being proper up by the Communist party, lay behind  today's carnage,"" the ""Mad Money"" host.  The complete rollover of the commodity sector has investors  thinking that something evil lurking in China might take the whole world down with it. This was evident when the  breathtaking collapse of raw goods on Friday had things falling  apart all over the place.  All over the place... except for the United States. In fact, Cramer  suspects that the confluence of the robust economy in the U.S.  with problems overseas will really hit home next  week. (Tweet This)  On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will be making its decision on  interest rates. Due to the very robust job growth currently in  the U.S., the Fed is widely expected to confirm that it will  raise interest rates in September.  Cramer gives the Fed some credit, as it held off tightening  earlier because it was worried about the impact of a  Greek-related disaster in Europe. But now that the Greek drama is  over, should the bulls hope that the Fed will hold off again  because of China?  Or will it decide that growth without commodity inflation is a  good thing and not do anything? Or will it say that the U.S. has  wage inflation, so it is time to raise rates?  The ""Mad Money"" host does not know the answers to these  questions. The one thing he does know, though, is that Friday's  selloff was directly correlated to fears that the Fed will be too  hawkish. Cramer did not like that the market refused to rally,  even after receiving some stunning earnings from companies.  At this point if the Fed were to raise rates, Cramer thinks it  would send the dollar soaring, which would prompt U.S. based  international companies to do poorly, which would then result in  negative earnings in the future.  ""In short, I think there is a heightened risk of a further  rollover, but as I always say, this kind of a selloff will give  you an opportunity to buy high-quality stocks at bargain basement  prices,"" Cramer said.  It doesn't take a genius to realize that the near-term investing  world is looking pretty bleak. Cramer can see the combination of  lack of market leadership, too few stocks going higher, a general  feeling of teetering all add up to the notion that we have topped  out for now.  ""Here's how I want you to think about it: China is the new  Greece, and the market is not done discounting the possible woes  of the most populous country on Earth,"" Cramer said.  With this in mind, Cramer geared up for earnings next week. Here  is what he will have his eye on:Monday: , BaiduTuesday: DR Horton, DuPont, Gilead, TwitterWednesday: FacebookThursday: Procter & Gamble, MondelezFriday: Exxon Mobil &  Chevron. ""The worst stocks  in this market, perhaps the worst I've seen in ages, are the  oils. How fitting that Exxon and Chevron both report,"" Cramer  said.  ----------------------------------------------------------  Read more from Mad Money with Jim Cramer Cramer Remix: My  unbelievable reaction to Amazon Cramer: Smartest  stocks of the S&P riptide Starbucks tells  Cramer: Best quarter in history  ----------------------------------------------------------  The ""Mad Money"" host is looking to hear what both companies say  about the long-term view of oil. Will it be a V-shaped recovery?  Are things going to get worse before they get better? Oil is in a  free-fall, and these two companies can make sense of it.  At the end of the day, Cramer doesn't like it when good earnings  mean so little in the market, like they did on Friday. Right now,   the market is all about Chinese pain and Fed worries. Cramer says  to keep all eyes on longer term opportunities that could present  themselves, that have little to do with the Fed or China.  Questions for Cramer?

2015-08-06,Dow posts 6-day losing streak as media stocks plunge; jobs in focus,0.03567400192400193,"U.S. stocks closed lower on Thursday, with the Nasdaq off 1.6  percent, as investors weighed declines in oil and disappointing  earnings ahead of Friday's key employment report. (Tweet This)  ""There's nervousness among momentum investors caused by some of  the outperforming names either missing or giving cautious  comments in earnings reports,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief market  strategist at Boston Private Wealth.   ""I don't think much of it is warranted,"" he said, noting some  profit-taking.   The major averages came off session lows in the close. The Dow  Jones industrial average ended at its lowest level in 6 months  and posted its first 6-day losing streak since October.  Stocks extended losses in midday trade as the S&P 500 broke  through a key level of 2,087 that many analysts were watching.  The index closed below that level but held above its 200-day  moving average of 2,072.   Art Cashin, director of floor operations at UBS, said the next  level of support is 2,063 to 2,067.   Viacom and 21st Century Fox plunged, joining Disney in a  post-earnings stock decline to bring the media sector down about  8 percent for the week so far. At its lows the media sector was  off about 11 percent for the week, on track for its worst week since October  2008, when it lost 21.87 percent.   The media sector weighed on consumer discretionary, off more than  1 percent as one of the greatest decliners in the S&P  500.  Read MoreAmid media carnage,  opportunities may abound  Health care was the worst sector performer, falling more than 2  percent as biotechs plunged. The declines weighed heavily on the  Nasdaq, which closed more than 1.5 percent lower.  The iShares Nasdaq  biotechnology ETF (IBB) fell 4.3 percent,  while Apple reversed recent declines to end mildly  higher.   The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 120 points lower,  after falling as much as 177 points.   The greatest weight on the index was Disney, which closed 1.8 percent lower,  off an earlier 5.5 percent decline. The stock extended its  post-earnings plunge from Wednesday after the firm missed on  revenue and disappointed investors with subscriber losses.  Year-to-date, the stock is the third-best performer in the Dow.  ""You've got some nervousness ahead of the jobs report, lack of a  bullish impetus, narrowing leadership,"" said Adam Sarhan, CEO of  Sarhan Capital. ""The market continues to get weaker, not  stronger.""   He is watching 2,040 on the S&P 500. ""Right now there're less  and less bullish drivers and concurrently more bearish drivers,""  Sarhan said. ""If support breaks there's no question on my mind  (that we get a correction).""   ""Market participants are really groping for a new catalyst to  move stocks higher,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment  strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. ""There's still some  questions on the economy, the pace of growth.""   He noted there were few indications that the market was strongly  concerned about an interest rate hike, as bond yields held lower,  the dollar was flat, and gold traded a touch higher.   ""The rise in the Treasury market is a take of two separate things  moving in different directions,"" said Eric Stein, co-director of global fixed income at Eaton Vance Management. He noted hawkish comments from policymakers balanced by ""the continued selloff in commodity prices."" ""It's not all about September, it's obviously about the path of rates (in the next) two to three years,"" Stein said. Friday's jobs report is one of the few key pieces of data expected before the Federal Reserve meets in September and could potentially find enough impetus for raising short-term interest rates. Economists expect 223,000 nonfarm payrolls on Friday, with  unemployment unchanged at 5.3 percent, according to Thomson  Reuters.  ""I think this (jobs) report is what everyone's keying on. We've  kind of got mixed messages in the data this week,"" said Chris  Gaffney, president of EverBank World Markets.   ""I think the key is average hourly earnings and if that comes  with a 2 percent increase tomorrow, absolutely September comes  into play,"" Gaffney said.  Read MoreEarnings? Who cares.  All eyes are on Jobs Friday  ""I think the market is really getting anxious about nonfarm  payrolls,"" said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at Voya  Investment Management. ""If it's a moderate number, then (liftoff)  could be put off, but if it's a really big number  tomorrow—if unemployment is 5.2 percent—the market  struggles a little bit, raise the prospect of a September rate  increase.""  Jobs data so far this week was mixed. Initial claims came in Thursday  at 270,000, slightly below expectations. The private sector  report from ADP showed fewer-than-expected jobs were created. U.S. job cuts in July  exceeded 100,000 for the first time in nearly four years as the  military announced plans to reduce troop and civilian  workforce payrolls, according to Challenger, Gray &  Christmas. A year ago, U.S. companies announced plans to cut  46,887 jobs.  However, the major jump in job cuts is not expected to  significantly affect Friday's key report.  ""We think this increase in announced job cuts will have no impact  on the July BLS report, and only a minimal impact on the  employment data over the next few years. The jump in layoffs  announced in July was basically entirely due to reductions  announced by the US Army that are scheduled to begin in October  and be implemented over the next two years,"" JPMorgan said in a  morning note.   Oil continued to decline, with WTI crude settling down 49 cents,  or 1.09 percent, at $44.66 a barrel. Brent dipped below $48 a  barrel.  ""I know that a lot of people that are bearish,"" said Phil Flynn,  energy market analyst at Price Futures Group. ""As weak as the  market feels right now the onus is on the bears to take out $40 a  barrel. Really we're following a seasonal pattern.""   In Europe, equities  closed lower as crude weighed on sentiment and the Bank  of England kept rates unchanged.  Analysts said the central bank's position could be an indication  that the U.S. Federal Reserve also holds off on raising  rates.  Read MoreDoves dominate as Bank  of England holds rates  The dollar traded mildly lower, with the euro above $1.09 and the  yen little changed against the greenback at 124.7 yen.

About 80 percent of names in  the S&P 500 have reported.  There are ""tons of stocks reporting earnings. We've had a tough  morning because they've been volatile,"" said Phil Quartuccio, CEO  of Illustro Trading. ""Earnings (are) surprising on both  ends.""  Viacom fell 14  percent and is in a bear market. The firm matched earnings per  share estimates but missed on revenue as advertising sales  declined and lack of major movie releases from the firm during  the quarter. 21st Century  Fox declined 6.4 percent after reporting earnings that  topped estimates on revenue that missed. The media company also  announced a $5 billion stock buyback program. CBS gained  3.6 percent after the firm reported an adjusted quarterly profit  of 74 cents per share, 2 cents above estimates, with revenue  essentially in line. CBS benefited from higher subscription fees  and increasing revenue from affiliates.  Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities,  expects some recovery in media names.   ""There's a lot of wreckage after Disney,"" he said. ""I think  things got overdone.""  Keurig Green Mountain plunged  nearly 30 percent after the firm missed significantly on revenue  and sales of its coffee pods fell for the first time ever.  The single-serve coffee company also lowered its sales and  earnings forecasts and announced it would cut 5 percent of its  workforce.

Herbalife surged 17.2 percent  after the firm reported earnings that beat estimates on both the  top and bottom line. The nutritional products company raised its  full-year earnings guidance, even as its sales are impacted by a  stronger dollar. Tesla closed down about 8.9  percent despite posting a lower-than-expected decline in earnings  on revenue that beat.

WARREN BUFFETT IS CALLING  INTO  THE CONTROL ROOM IS JUST A MINUTE THEY ARE PAYING $235  PER SHARE IN CASH THIS IS A STOCK THAT CLOSED AT $193.88 ON  FRIDAY SO WE WILL BE TALKING MUCH MORE ABOUT THIS.  I THINK  RIGHT NOW WE DO HAVE WARREN BUFFETT ON THE LINE. SIR ARE YOU  THERE? SO WE SEE THE NEWS THAT IS OUT TODAY THIS COMES AS A  SURPRISE TO A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT THE WALL STREET JOURNAL DID  REPORT THIS ON SATURDAY I WONDER WHEN DID YOU FIRST HEAR ABOUT  THIS, WHEN DID YOU FIRST TALK TO THIS COMPANY AND HOW DID THIS  DEAL HAPPEN? BUFFETT:  I WOULD SAY IS WAS ABOUT 5 WEEKS AGO.   YOU HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO TODD COMBS FOR THE DEAL WE HIRED TODD  ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO TO MANAGE MONEY AND HE MANAGES ABOUT 9 BILLION  NOW AND MAYBE THREE OR SO YEARS AGO  HE ADDED PRECISION TO  HIS PORTFOLIO AND I REALLY NEVER HEARD ABOUT THE COMPANY BEFORE  THAT AND TODD TOLD ME A LOT ABOUT IT AND OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS  I HAVE BECOME FAMILIAR WITH IT AND ABOUT 5 OR SO WEEKS AGO THE  CEO MARK DONEGAN ALONG WITH HIS CFO AND IR PERSON CAME BY  BERKSHIRE THEY WERE SEEING BERKSHIRE HOLDERS AND THEY MET WITH  TODD AND THEN I DROPPED IN ON THE VISIT AND IN THE LAST 15  MINUTES OR SO AND I WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY MARK AND OF COURSE I  HAD BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE COMPANY SO SHORTLY THEREAFTER I STOPPED  AND GIVE THEM A CALL TO SEE IF THEY WOULD BE OFFENDED IF WE MADE  A BID AND THEY DIDN'T INDICATE THEY WERE PARTICULARLY RECEPTIVE  BUT THEY ALSO INDICATED THEY WOULD LISTEN SO I SUBSEQUENTLY MADE  A BID. I MET MARK OUT AT SUN VALLEY, HE WAS ACTUALLY IN THE AIR  MOST OF THE TIME AND SO HE CAME BY BECAUSE I WAS THERE FOR THE  ALLEN COMPANY CONFERENCE AND I MADE HIM A BID AND HE TOOK IT TO  THE BOARD AND BEFORE LONG WE HAD A DEAL. SORKIN:  WARREN I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU I SAW BECKY THE  WEEK AFTER SUN VALLEY AND I SAID BUT WARREN IS DOING A DEAL I HAD  SEEN YOU AT SUN VALLEY. YOU HAD THAT PHONE WITH YOU SO INTENSE  THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON AND I THOUGHT I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS  IS WHAT YOU WERE DOING.  BUFFETT: I WILL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN I AM AROUND YOU  ANDREW IF YOU CAN READ MY FACE LIKE THAT.  SORKIN: FROM A PRICE PERSPECTIVE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE  HAD FROM AN EBITA I WAS DOING IT OFF OF THE $30 BILLION AND  THINKING THIS WAS ABOUT 20 TIMES EBITA WHICH I WAS SAYING NOT THE  CHEAPEST DEAL IN TOWN.  IT DOES ALLOW YOU TO SPEND A LOT OF  MONEY QUICKLY.  IN TERMS OF THE VALUATION THOUGH HOW DO YOU  THINK ABOUT IT AND WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SPENDING THIS KIND  OF MONEY IS IT HARDER AND HARDER AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER  TO ACTUALLY GET A REALLY CHEAP DEAL? BUFFETT: IT IS NOT 20 TIMES EBITA THOUGH ANDREW. I AM NOT  SURE WHAT FIGURES YOU ARE LOOKING AT THERE BUT ALL DEALS SEEM  EXPENSIVE TO ME BUT THIS ONE WE ARE CERTAINLY PAYING A VERY GOOD  PRICE FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY COMPANY RUN BY A PERSON THAN AS FAR AS  I AM CONCERNED HE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD AT WHAT HE  DOES.  SORKIN: HE'S MADE A NUMBER OF DEALS OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF  YEARS ABOUT 8 BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF TRANSACTIONS WHEN YOU LOOK  AT THIS COMPANY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS DO YOU IMAGINE  USING A LOT OF BERKSHIRE CASH TO MAKE ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS TO  USE IT AS A ROLL UP VEHICLE IF YOU WILL? BUFFETT: WELL ITS ALWAYS ACQUIRED COMPANIES I DON'T KNOW  HOW MANY ACQUISITIONS THEY MADE OVER THE YEARS BUT IT IS A LOT.   BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT GO INTO AEROSPACE IN  THE WAY OF PARTS AND THEY'VE GONE AFTER ONE ITEM AFTER ANOTHER  OVER THE YEARS.  IN FACT THEY'VE MADE A COUPLE SMALL DEALS I  BELIEVE IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER AND I THINK THEY'VE GOT MAYBE  ONE PENDING OR SO.  NOW THEY MAKE A GOOD BIT OF MONEY SO  THEY WILL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO DO THE ACQUISITIONS OR MANY OF THE  ACQUISITIONS INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS BUT IF THEY NEED ANY  MONEY FROM BERKSHIRE ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS CALL.  QUICKLY: WARREN THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE DEAL IS THIS THE MOST  EXPENSIVE DEAL EVER?  HOW DOES IT MATCH UP TO BURLINGTON  NORTHERN? BUFFETT: WELL THE MOST DEALS ARE THE ONES THAT DON'T WORK  OUT.  YOU MENTIONED DEXTER SHOE A LITTLE WHILE AGO. BUT IN  TERMS OF PRICE EARNINGS MULTIPLES GOING IN THIS IS RIGHT UP THERE  AT THE TOP NOW WHEN WE BOUGHT BURLINGTON THAT WAS A HIGH PE BUT  IT WAS OFF A VERY DEPRESSED FIGURE BECAUSE WE BOUGHT THAT IN THE  FALL OF 2009 WHEN EARNINGS WERE AT A TROUGH.  AND PRECISIONS  EARNINGS HAVE FALLEN OFF MODERATELY BECAUSE OF DEVELOPMENTS IN  THE OIL AND GAS FIELD WHERE THEY DO SOME BUSINESS AS WELL AS IN  AEROSPACE SO BUT THIS IS A VERY HIGH MULTIPLE FOR US. SULLIVAN: YOU READ MY MIND ON OIL AND GAS HOW MUCH OF THIS  IF AT ALL IS A BET THAT THE U.S. OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY MAY BE  BOTTOMING OUT AT LEAST FROM A PRICE PERSPECTIVE? BUFFETT: WELL WE ARE GOING TO BE IN THIS BUSINESS FOR A 100  YEARS SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHAT OIL AND GAS  DOES IN THE NEXT YEAR IN TERMS OF US BUYING IT.  IF SOMEONE  TOLD ME FOR SURE THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS WAS GOING TO BE IN THE  DULDRUMS WE'LL SAY FOR 3 YEARS I STILL WOULD HAVE MADE THE  DEAL.  THAT'S NOT A PREDICTION I AM JUST SAYING IT IS NOT  IMPORTANT TO US HOW LONG THE OIL AND GAS SLUMP LASTS WHEN YOU GET  A CHANCE TO BUY A WONDERFUL COMPANY YOU KNOW THERE IS USUALLY  SOME REASON WHY YOU ARE GETTING THAT CHANCE AND PERHAPS THE SLUMP  IN OIL AND GAS HELPS US IN THIS CASE.  BUT THERE WILL BE  SOMEDAY THERE WILL BE A SLUMP IN AEROSPACE AND THAT WILL BE MUCH  MORE SEVERE FOR A COMPANY LIKE THIS BUT IF YOU LOOK OVER THE  DECADES BOTH OIL AND GAS AND AEROSPACE WILL BE GOOD BUSINESS AND  THESE FELLOWS ARE THEIR KEY PARTICULARLY IN THE AEROSPACE  BUSINESS THE INDUSTRY NEEDS THEM THEY'RE UNIVERSALLY REGARDED AS  THE MOST RELIABLE INNOVATIVE  DEPENDABLE SUPPLIER OF VERY  KEY PARTS THAT GO INTO ALL KINDS OF AIRCRAFTS.  SORKIN: WARREN SPEAK TO THE DEFENSIVE MODE THAT YOU OFTEN  TALK ABOUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT PARTICULAR COMPANY IN TERMS OF  ITS MARKETSHARE AND ITS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN IF NOT GROW THAT  MARKETSHARE BUFFETT:  WELL WHAT YOU NEED IS YOU NEED PEOPLE THAT  HAVE PHYSICAL FACILITIES BUT THAT IS A SMALL PART OF IT.   THEY DO HAVE MARVELOUS PHYSICAL FACILITIES BUT WHAT YOU REALLY  NEED IS BRAIN POWER AND YOU NEED PARTICULARLY AT THE TOP YOU NEED  SOMEBODY WITH A TOTAL PASSION FOR THE BUSINESS AND I'VE MET MARK  FOUR OR FIVE TIMES AND EACH TIME HE'S BEEN IN THE AIR AND HE'S IN  THE AIR ALMOST A THOUSAND HOURS A YEAR THIS FELLOW LOVES THIS  BUSINESS LIKE I LOVE BERKSHIRE AND HE'S A LOT BETTER AT IT THAN I  AM AT BERKSHIRE. YOU CAN'T FIND PEOPLE LIKE THIS.  YOU  CERTAINLY CAN'T HIRE THEM.  THE ONE THING I GUARANTEE MARK  IS THAT HE'S RUNNING THE COMPANY.  PEOPLE LIKE THIS ARE VERY  VERY RARE.  YOU CAN SEE IT IN WHAT HE HAS BUILT AND YOU CAN  SEE IT IN THE PASSION HE'S GOT FOR WHAT HE IS DOING NOW.   HE'S NEVER SATISFIED IN TERMS OF GETTING MORE BUSINESS IN THE  AIRFRAME AND THE ENGINES.  HE'S NEVER SATISFIED IN TERMS OF  GETTING HIS COST TO WHERE THEY SHOULD BE.  HE JUST HAS A  PASSION FOR THE BUSINESS. QUICK:  WARREN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IN TERMS OF THE  CASH THAT YOU ARE USING FOR THIS?  I KNOW YOU LIKE TO KEEP  ABOUT 20 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH ON HAND.  ARE YOU STILL IN  THE MARKET FOR OTHER POTENTIAL DEALS? OR DOES THIS TAKE YOU OUT  OF THE MARKET FOR AWHILE? BUFFETT: THIS TAKES US OUT OF THE MARKET FOR AN ELEPHANT  BUT WE WILL PROBABLY BE BUYING A FEW SMALL THINGS IN THE NEXT 6  MONTHS.  WE ARE IN NEGOTIATIONS ON A COUPLE BUT IN TERMS OF  A DEAL OF SIMILAR SIZE IT PRETTY MUCH TAKES US OUT.  WHAT WE  WILL PROBABLY DO ON THIS ONE WE WILL PROBABLY BORROW ABOUT 10  BILLION AND USE ABOUT 23 BILLION OF OUR OWN CASH ON THAT  ORDER.  WE'LL BE LEFT WITH OVER 40 BILLION PROBABLY IN CASH  WHEN WE GET ALL THROUGH.  BUT I LIKE TO HAVE A LOT OF CASH  AT ALL TIMES SO THIS MEANS WE HAVE TO RELOAD OVER THE NEXT 12  MONTHS OR SO BUT IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE DOING SMALLER DEALS BUT WE  WILL BE DOING A FEW PROBABLY. SORKIN: AND WARREN ONE OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS YOU ALWAYS  TALK ABOUT TALENT AND SPECIAL PEOPLE AND SPECIAL BERKSHIRE PEOPLE  AND IT IS HARD TO FIND THEM.  WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT MARK DARE  I ASK THE QUESTION SHOULD WE START TO ADD HIM TO THE LIST OF  POTENTIAL PEOPLE THAT MAY ONLY RUN THIS PARTICULAR COMPANY NOW  BUT MAYBE PUT INTO THE BERKSHIRE FOLD WHEN IT SOMES TO  SUCCESSION? BUFFETT: IF I READ MARK CORRECTLY AND IN THIS RESPECT I AM  SURE I DO ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS RUN PRECISION AND TO TAKE IT TO  GREATER AND GREATER HEIGHTS HE DOES NOT WANT TO RUN  BERKSHIRE  AND TRUE OF MOST OF OUR MANAGERS THEY LOVE WHAT  THEY ARE DOING THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT.  I HAVE TO DECIDE  REALLY WHEN I BUY A COMPANY THERE IS NO WAY IN THE WORLD THAT I  COULD RUN PRECISION OR REALLY ANYBODY IN OUR OPERATION COULD SO  THE FIRST I ASK AND MARK'S 58 I ASK IF HE HAS ANY IDEAS AT 65  THAT HE'S GO AND PLAY SHUFFLE BOARD IN FLORIDA OR SOMETHING LIKE  THAT.  AS LONG AS WE TREAT HIM RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT TO TREAT  PEOPLE RIGHT WE TREAT HIM RIGHT HE WILL BE RUNNING THIS FOR  DECADES AND DECADES. AND THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO JUST LIKE I  LIKE RUNNING BERKSHIRE. QUICK: WARREN YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS WILL TAKE YOU OUT OF  THE HUNT FOR A BIG ELEPHANT FOR 12 MONTHS OR SO WHILE THE COMPANY  RELOADS WITH THE CASH  CONTINUALLY COMING IN.  JUST  LAST WEEK BILL ACKMAN MADE IT PUBLIC THAT HE HAS A LARGE STAKE IN  MONDELEZ ONE OF THE THINGS HE THOUGHT ABOUT IS POTENTIALLY  MONDELZ GETTING LUMPED IN WITH KRAFT HEINZ.  DOES THAT MEAN  IT IS NOT AN OPTION AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF BILL'S  PROPOSAL? BUFFETT: WELL I WILL LISTEN TO ANYTHING MY FRIENDS AT 3G  WANT TO DO BUT WITH KRAFT HEINZ WE HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US  FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.  I THINK IT IS QUITE UNLIKELY YOU  NEVER WANT TO SAY ANYTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT I THINK IT IS QUITE  UNLIKELY THAT KRAFT HEINZ WOULD BE DOING A BIG ACQUISITION IN THE  NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS SOMEWHERE DOWN THE ROAD I WOULDN'T BE  SURPRISED.  BUT IT ALSO WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SENSE FINANCIALLY  AND FRANKLY MOST OF THE FOOD COMPANIES SELL AT PRICES THAT IT  WOULD BE VERY HARD FOR US TO MAKE A DEAL EVEN IF WE HAD DONE ALL  OF THE WORK NEEDED AT KRAFT HEINZ.  A LOT OF THE COMPANIES  ARE SELLING AT PRICES THAT SORT OF REFLECT IMPROVEMENTS IN THEM  THAT PEOPLE SORT OF WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING AT KRAFT HEINZ AND  BELIEVE ME THIS IS NOT EASY. QUICK: MEANING THAT MONDELEZ AT THESE PRICES YOU WOULDN'T  LIKE? BUFFETT: WELL IT WOULD BE HARD FOR US TO MAKE A DEAL THAT  MAKES SENSE YEAH. BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS DOWN THE LINE BUT IF  YOU LOOK AT KELLOGG OR CAMPBELL'S SOUP  OR MONDELEZ THEY'RE  PRICES TO SOME EXTENT THE MARKET HAS PUT INTO THOSE COMPANIES  PRICES THAT REFLECT AN EXPECTATION KRAFT HEINZ TYPE MARGINS ARE  POSSIBLE AND THAT MAY BE THE CASE BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN IT  ELSEWHERE. SULLIVAN: MR BUFFETT IN 2009 MANY OF THE BANKS CAME TO YOU  FOR HELP. HAVE YOU HAD ANY OIL OR GAS COMPANIES COME TO YOU IN  THE LAST FEW MONTHS LOOKING FOR YOUR HELP, LOOKING FOR YOUR  INVESTMENT? BUFFETT: NOT YET BUT PRICES STAY DOWN HERE.  IF PRICES  STAY DOWN HERE SO FAR I WOULD SAY THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE  OIL AND GAS BUSINESS UP MAYBE UNTIL VERY RECENTLY THEY FELT THAT  OIL PRICES WOULD BOUNCE BACK.  THEY MAY NOT HAVE FELT GAS  PRICES WOULD BOUNCE MUCH BUT THEY FELT OIL PRICES WOULD BOUNCE  BACK.  THE OIL PRODUCTION COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SELLING ON A  BASIS NOT OF $45 WTI THEY HAVE ASSUMED HIGHER PRICES AND OF  COURSE THE FORWARD CURVE HAVE REFLECTED HIGHER PRICES.  I  THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD TO MAKE REALISTIC DEALS WITH OIL  AND GAS UP UNTIL NOW BUT WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE  FUTURE.  TO BE SPECIFIC NOBODY HAS COME TO ME. QUICK: DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU HAVE NOT MADE ANY OTHER  PURCHASES IN THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS? BUFFETT: THAT'S CORRECT QUICK: SO THERE IS NOTHING THAT YOU'VE SEEN ASIDE FROM THIS  DEAL TODAY THAT YOU THINK HAS BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY YOU WOULD BUY  INTO? BUFFETT: NO OF COURSE THIS IS KIND OF SECENDARY I WOULDN'T  SAY MAYBE 15% OF PRECISION'S BUSINESS HAD BEEN IN THERE AND THEY  GOT HURT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF QUARTERS SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE  WHEN OIL SLOWS DOWN IF THEY'VE GOT VARIOUS BUILDING EQUIPMENT ON  HAND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY DON'T NEED TO ORDER ANY FOR AWHILE EVEN  THOUGH CONTINUE TO PRODUCE.  SO NO WE HAVE NOT MADE ANY  COMMITMENTS IN OIL AND GAS. SORKIN: HEY WARREN EVERY TIME  I SEE YOU I ALWAYS ASK  THE QUESTION IBM, IBM UPDATE THE STOCK IS TRADING I THINK ABOUT  155 DOLLARS RIGHT ABOUT NOW HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT IT BUFFETT: I FEEL FINE. SORKIN: WHAT'S YOUR BASIS IN THAT COMPANY AT THIS  POINT? BUFFETT: WHAT'S OUR STOCK COST US? SORKIN: YEH BUFFETT: I WOULD SAY AROUND 170 SORKIN: AROUND 17O NOW BY MY MATH YOU HAVE ACTUALLY MADE  THE MONEY STILL ON THIS DEAL ON PART I THINK THE FUNCTION OF THE  DIVIDENDS BUT YOU ARE NOT CONCERNED AT ALL IN TERMS OF THE  STOCK BUFFETT: I LOVE IT WHEN IT GOES DOWN IT MEANS THE COMPANY  BUYS STOCK CHEAPER AND MEANS IF I WANT TO BUY MORE STOCK YOU CAN  LOOK AT OUR 13F IN A FEW DAYS IT MEANS I GET TO BUY IT  CHEAPER QUICK: DOES THAT MEAN YOU'VE BEEN BUYING IT? BUFFETT: I AM NOT A SELLER OF STOCK.  PEOPLE ASSUME  WHEN WE BUY SOME STOCK WE WANT IT TO GO UP.  WE DON'T WANT  IT TO GO UP MAYBE OBVIOUSLY EVENTUALLY MAYBE FIVE OR TEN YEARS  FROM NOW BUT WE LOVE THE IDEA OF A COMPANY BUYING ITS STOCK  CHEAPER. I MEAN THAT'S HAPPENED AT AMERICAN EXPRESS FOR INSTANCE  AMERICAN EXPRESS IS A REGULAR REPURCHASER OF SHARES AND WE OWN  15% OF IT AND OWNERSHIP GOES UP FASTER IF THE STOCK IS DOWN THAN  IF THE STOCK IS UP.  SULLIVAN: WE HAD ON FRIDAY A BILLION DOLLAR ACTIVIST  INVESTMENT IN AMERICAN EXPRESS MR BUFFETT JEFFREY UBEN OF  VALUEACT CAPITAL.  WHEN YOU OWN A STOCK LIKE AN AMERICAN  EXPRESS ARE YOU HAPPY TO SEE AN ACTIVIST COME IN DO YOU WELCOME  IT. BUFFETT: NO NOT PARTICULARLY BUT IT IS UP TO THEM WHAT THEY  DO WITH THEIR MONEY.  ACTUALLY IT SENDS UP FOUR OR FIVE  POINTS SO THE EXTENT THAT AMERICAN EXPRESS IS REPURCHASING SHARES  WE CAN'T BUY STOCKS IN AMERICAN EXPRESS BECAUSE IT IS A  BANKHOLDING COMPANY AND WE OWN OVER 10% BUT THE CHEAPER THE STOCK  IS THE MORE SHARES AMERICAN EXPRESS WILL BE ABLE TO REPURCHASE  FOR A GIVEN AMOUNT OF MONEY AND ON BALANCE THAT HELPS US WE'RE  BUYING YOU KNOW THERE IS NO MORAL PROBLEM ATTACHED TO IT BECAUSE  IT TAKES PLACE IN THE MARKET BUT WE'RE ON OUR PARTNERS  CHEAPER. QUICK: LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS ALSO A LOT  CHEAPER THAN IT WAS A WEEK AGO YOU LOOKS AT THE MEDIA STOCKS  DISNEY KICKED IT OFF WHEN BOB IGER SAID THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT  ESPN, VERY BRIEF CONCERNS FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE THE MARKET TOOK  THAT AS A HUGE SELLING POINT NOT ONLY FOR DISNEY BUT ALL OF THE  MEDIA RELATED STOCKS DO YOU SEE ANYTHING IN THE MEDIA INDUSTRY  YOU LIKE AT THESE PRICES? BUFFETT: NO I WOULD SAY THAT I CONSIDER BOB IGER AND I KNOW  HIM WELL AND HAD EXPERIENCE WITH HIM MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO I  THINK HE IS ONE OF THE GREAT MANAGERS IN AMERICA AND A GOOD GUY  BEYOND THAT BUT I'M AN OBSERVER OF THE MEDIA PICTURE TODD AND  TEDD OWN SOME SHARES IN CERTAIN MEDIA STOCKS BUT I AM NO VICTIM  OF THIS MYSELF AND THE SELL OFF DID NOT ENTICE ME. SORKIN: HEY WARREN SPEAKING OF BUYBACKS ONE OF THE  QUESTIONS AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS SINCE YOU  SENT YOUR LETTER AND WE HAD YOU ON THE SHOW BUT LARRY FINK FROM  BLACKROCK SENT A LETTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO TO CEOS AROUND THE  COUNTRY AND SAID LOOK STOP WITH THE BUYBACKS, STOP WITH THE  DIVIDENDS WE WANT YOU INVESTING IN THE FUTURE AND IN PART I WOULD  ARGUE THAT LETTER SEEMED TO INSPIRE HILLARY CLINTON WITH HER  LATEST QUARTERLY CAPITALISM APPROACH AND PROGRAM THAT SHE'S TALK  ABOUT IN TERMS OF CHANGING THE TAX STRUCTURE CAPITAL GAINS  STRUCTURE AROUND INVESTMENTS.  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT  HILLARY CLINTON HAD TO SAY AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT LARRY  FINK HAD TO SAY? BUFFETT: WELL PEOPLE MAKE BUYBACKS VERY COMPLICATED.    BUYBACKS MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU ARE BUYING YOUR STOCK BACK  BELOW ITS INTRINSIC VALUE AND WHEN YOU DON'T NEED THAT MONEY FOR  THE NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS.  IT MAKES NO SENSE WHEN YOU PAY  ABOVE INTRINSIC VALUE AND THAT'S A VERY SIMPLE PRINCIPAL BUT IT  HAS BEEN IGNORED BY MANY MANAGEMENTS OVER TIME.  IF YOU LOOK  AT THE HISTORY OF BUYBACKS PEOPLE BUYBACK A LOT IN TERMS OF  AGRIGATE BUYBACKS PEOPLE BUY A LOT MORE STOCK BACK WHEN STOCKS  ARE UP THAN WHEN THEY ARE DOWN BUT IN THAT WAY THEY ARE SORT OF  BEHAVING LIKE JOE PUBLIC YOU KNOW.  THERE HAVE BEEN SOME  GREAT INVESTMENT STORIES BASED ON PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT BACK STOCK  INTELLIGENTLY WHICH MEANS BUYING IT AT A DISCOUNT FROM ITS  INTRINSIC VALUE.  WE WOULD BUY BACK STOCK BY THE BUSHELL  BASKETS IF IT SOLD WELL BELOW INTRINSIC VALUE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE  WELL BELOW INTRINSIC VALUE AND WE WON'T BUY A SHARE IF WE   THINK WE ARE PAYING INTRINSIC VALUE OR MORE. IT IS NOT A  COMPLICATED EQUATION BUT MANAGEMENTS WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS THEY ARE  GOING TO HAVEA 5 BILLION DOLLAR BUYBACK THEY OUGHT TO SAY WE ARE  HAVING A 5 BILLION DOLLAR BUYBACK IF WE CAN BUY IT AT X OR BELOW  BUT THAT'S JUST NOT THE WAY IT OPERATES. SULLIVAN:  HAS IT BEEN AN EFFICIENT USE OF  CAPITAL BUFFETT: IT HAS BEEN A TERRIFICLY EFFICIENT USE OF CAPITAL  FOR SOME COMPANIES AND BEEN A VERY STUPID USE OF CAPITAL FOR  OTHER COMPANIES.  I WOULD ARGUE THAT OUR BUYBACKS HAVE BEEN  PEANUTS UNFORTUNATELY  BUT OUR COUPLE OF BUYBACKS MADE GREAT  SENSE.  BUT WE COULDN'T DO IT ON SCALE.  SORKIN: AND WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF HILLARY CLINTONS PROPOSAL  ON CAPITAL GAINS BUT SHE ALSO SAID I BELIEVE THAT SHE WANTS  PEOPLE TO LOOK INTO BUYBACKS THEMSELVES IN TERMS OF HOW THEY  SHOULD BE REGULATED.  ELIZABETH WARREN  AND OTHERS HAVE  SUGGESTED THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY INSIDER TRADING BECAUSE THE  COMPANIES KNOW ABOUT IT. BUFFETT: WELL I WILL BE GLAD TO WRITE A PAPER ON IT  SOMETIME.  I HAVE WRITTEN ON IT ABOUT 20 TIMES OVER THE  YEARS AND IN GENERAL VERY MUCH APPROVE OF WHERE HILLARY IS GOING  IN TERMS OF FINE TUNING ALL THE POINTS WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT AS  THE CAMPAIGN PROGRESSES.  BUT BUYBACKS ARE NOT NIRVANA AND  THEY ARE NOT EVIL IT IS JUST A QUESTION OR WHETHER THEY MAKE  SENSE AND IF OUR STOCK SELLS WELL BELOW INTRINSIC VALUE AND WE  HAVE MONEY WE DON'T NEED FOR THE BUSINESS WE WILL BUY IT BACK  JUST AS FAST AS WE CAN NOW UNFORTUNATELY WHENEVER I SAY THAT IT  KEEPS IT FROM HAPPENING. QUICK: WARREN WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE A SUPPORTER OF HILLARY  CLINTON BUT DID YOU WATCH THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL DEBATES THAT  TOOK PLACE LAST WEEK? BUFFETT: I WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED IT QUICK: AND WHAT DID YOU THINK? BUFFETT: I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TERRIFIC TELEVISION AND I  THINK THERE'S A SMALL CHANCE WITH PROPORTIONAL AWARDING DELEGATES  IN A GREAT MANY OF THE PRIMARIES AND WITH SUPER PACKS ENABLING  PEOPLE TO KEEP GETTING FINANCE WHERE AS OTHERWISE THEY WOULD DROP  OUT FOR LACK OF MONEY IF THEY WEREN'T DOING THAT WELL.  I  THINK THERE IS ACTUALLY SOME CHANCE THAT WHEN THEY GO TO THE  REPUBLICAN CONVENTION NO ONE WILL HAVE A MAJORITY GOING IN BUT I  THINK IT WILL BE VERY VERY INTERESTING.  DONALD TRUMP IS  GOING TO HAVE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF DELEGATES AND SO WILL A  WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHERS AND IN THE PAST UNLESS YOU WERE IN THE TOP  2 OR 3 YOUR FUNDING DRIES UP AND YOU GET TO A COUPLE OF STATES  AND THAT WAS WITH BUT WITH SUPER PACKS AROUND YOU CAN HAVE QUITE  A FEW CANDIDATES IN IT FOR QUITE A BIT OF TIME AND THE PIE COULD  GET DIVIDED IN SUCH A WAY THAT NOBODY HAS A MAJORITY.  IT IS  GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING.  IT IS A GREAT SPECTATOR  SPORT. QUICK: WE DID HAVE AN OVERNIGHT POLL AN NBC NEWS POLL THAT  WAS CONDUCTED FROM FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY IT SHOWED THAT DONALD  TRUMP IS STILL LEADING THE PACK WHICH MIGHT COME AS A SURPRISE TO  SOME PUNDITS WHO HAD KIND OF WRITTEN HIM OFF AFTER THAT  PERFORMANCE. BUFFETT: YEH NO HE IF YOU CAN GET BY THE JOHN MCCAIN IS NOT  A HERO AND A FEW THINGS AND NOT HAVE YOUR NUMBERS GO DOWN YOU  HAVE A VERY SOLID BASE AND YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HE  MAINTAINS QUITE A SOLID BASE FOR A LONG TIME. AND THAT MEANS HE  IS GOING TO GET A FAIR NUMBER OF DELEGATES IF YOU GET IT IN  PROPORTIONAL STATES. AND HE IS NOT GOING TO RUN OUT OF MONEY SO  IT IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF FUN TO WATCH PARTICULARLY IF YOU ARE A  DEMOCRAT.  QUICK: I WAS GOING TO SAY AS A DEMOCRAT YOU MUST ENJOY HOW  THIS PLAYS OUT.  WHO WOULD YOU MOST LIKE TO SEE YOUR  CANDIDATE RUN AGAINST? BUFFETT: WELL I THINK IF I GAVE THAT PREDICTION IT WOULD BE  SORT OF THE KISS OF DEATH ON THAT CANDIDATE.  I WANT TO SEE  HER RUN AGAINST THE WHOLE FIELD.  QUICK: YOU KNOW WARREN WE HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER  THINGS WE WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WE SAW THE JOBS NUMBER  THAT CAME IN.  THE JOBS REPORT WAS JUST AS EXPECTED ON  FRIDAY 215,000 A LOT OF PEOPLE SPECULATING THAT THE FED WILL  RAISE INTEREST RATES COME SEPTEMBER.  YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD  IDEA OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY JUST BASED ON THE NUMBERS  THAT YOU SEE AND THE BUSINESSES THAT YOU HAVE YOUR FINGER ON THE  PULSE.  WHAT DO YOU THINK IS HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY.   WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FED SHOULD DO IN SPETEMBER? BUFFETT: I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE ECONOMY IS  EXACTLY WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING NOW FOR FIVE YEARS IS THAT IT IS  MOVING AHEAD ROUGHLY AT 2% RATE AND IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES A SPURT  OCCASSIONALLY AUTOS ARE STRONG RIGHT NOW BUT IT HAS BEEN A VERY  STEADY INCREASE AND PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT DOUBLE DIPS AND  THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT ACCELERATION AND EVERY TIME THEY TALK ABOUT  IT MOVING SHARPLY IN ONE DIRECTION IT DOESN'T DO IT.   THE  ECONOMY HAS COME BACK AND IT HAS COME BACK VERY WELL  CONSIDERING THE KIND OF SHOCK THAT WE HAD 5 OR 6 YEARS AGO BUT I  DON'T SEE IT PARTICULARLY ACCELERATING AND I DON'T SEE IT  DECELERATING EITHER.  I HAVE SAID BEFORE I THINK IT IS VERY  TOUGH TO PUSH RATES HIGHER IN THE U.S. WHEN EUROPE NEEDS TO KEEP  THEM ALL AND YOU'VE GOT THE SITUATION EXISTING AROUND THE WORLD  BUT I KEEP HEARING THE VARIOUS GOVERNORS SAY IT IS GOING TO  HAPPEN SOON SO BUT I DON'T THINK IT IS AN EASY DECISION WHEN  RATES ARE CONSIDERABLY LOWER IN EUROPE AND YOU MAY BE AFFECTING  EXPORTS AND IMPORTS VERY SIGNIFICANTLY IF YOU PUSH RATES HERE TO  BE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THEY EXIST IN EUROPE. QUICK: THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN  CONCERNED ABOUT THE MARKET LATELY IF YOU HAVE WATCHED WHAT HAS  BEEN HAPPENING DURING EARNINGS SEASON SOME OF THE MOVES HAVE BEEN  EXTRAORDINARY TO SEE PEOPLE MISSING BY SMALL AMOUNTS ON EARNINGS  OR REVENUE LINES AND THEN COMING IN WITH DOUBLE DIGIT STOCK  DECLINES YOU ALSO SAW WHAT HAPPENED WITH MEDIA STOCKS OVERALL  MOVE THE ENTIRE SECTOR LOWER THAT HAS SOME PEOPLE THINKING THAT  THERE IS A LOT OF WEAKNESS IN THE MARKET AND THAT THERE IS  SOMETHING OF A CORRECTION THAT'S DUE.  I AM GUESSING THAT I  WOULDN'T PUT YOU IN THAT CAMP IF YOU ARE WILLING TO DO DEALS LIKE  THIS OR DO YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING ON A DAY TO DAY  BASIS? BUFFETT: STOCKS ARE GOING TO BE HIGHER AND PERHAPS A LOT  HIGHER 10 YEARS FROM NOW, 20 YEARS FROM NOW I AM NOT SMART ENOUGH  TO PICK TIMES TO GET IN AND GET OUT IF YOU ARE IN SOMETHING THAT  IS GOING TO BE A LOT HIGHER OVER TIME.  IF YOU THOUGHT YOUR  HOUSE WAS GOING TO GO DOWN 5% IN PRICE YOU WOULDN'T SELL YOUR  HOUSE AND HOPE TO BUY IT BACK 5% CHEAPER.  THAT'S NOT MY  GAME.  MY GAME IS TO OWN DECENT BUSINESSES AND OWN THEM AT  DECENT PRICES AND YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OVER TIME  IF YOU DO IT BUT I THINK THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO DANCE IN AND  OUT OF MARKETS IS QUITE LIMITED AND IN MY CASE IT IS  ZERO.  QUICK:  WARREN THERE IS A STORY ON THE FRONT PAGE OF  THE NEW YORK TIMES TODAY ABOUT COCA COLA WHICH IS A COMPANY THAT  YOU ALSO THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER IN IT POINTS OUT THAT COCA COLA  HAS TEAMED UP WITH SOME INFLUENTIAL SCIENTISTS TO TRY AND ADVANCE  A MESSAGE IN MEDICAL JOURNALS  THAT IT IS REALLY MORE ABOUT  HOW MUCH YOU EXERCISE NOT WHAT YOU EAT THAT MATTERS.  THE  TIMES ACTUALLY KIND OF PUTS THIS AS SOMETHING WHERE THEY LOOK   ASKANCE THE IDEA THAT BIG COPORATION IS FUNDING A MESSAGE  LIKE THIS WHAT DO YOU SAY AS THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER? BUFFETT:  WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR WEIGHT DEPENDS ON HOW  MUCH YOU TAKE IN AND HOW MUCH YOU BURN UP.  AND IF YOU TAKE  IN 2700 CALORIES AND YOU BURN UP 2700 YOUR WEIGHT ISN'T GOING TO  CHANGE AND IF YOU TAKE IN 3500 AND BURN 2500 YOU ARE GOING TO  GAIN WEIGHT.  IT'S A MATHEMATICAL TYPE EQUATION AND IF YOU  ARE LIKE ME AND DON'T LIKE TO EXERCISE MUCH THAN YOU BETTER NOT  TAKE IN TOO MUCH.  THERE IS NO MYSTERY TO WEIGHT.   CALORIES ARE DEFINED THERE'S 4 PER GRAM IF YOU ARE DEALING WITH  PROTEIN AND CARBOHYDRATES THERE'S 9 PER GRAM WITH FAT AND YOU'VE  GOT TO FIGURE IT OUT IF YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT SO YOUR BODY  BURNS OFF AS MANY AS YOU ARE CONSUMING.

2015-08-21,Flash China Caixin PMI falls to 47.1 in August,0.02127039627039627,"The preliminary reading for a key  Chinese purchasing managers' index  (PMI) fell to a near six-and-a-half-year low of 47.1 in  August, below a Reuters forecast of 47.7, underscoring persistent  sluggishness in country's vast factory sector.  The final Caixin China PMI dropped to a  two-year low of 47.8 in July, while the official  China PMI avoided falling into contraction territory by coming in  at 50 for the month. Caixin's China PMI data tends to focus on  smaller and medium-sized companies, filling a niche that isn't  covered by the official data.  ""The Caixin Flash China General Manufacturing PMI for August has  fallen further from July's two-year low, indicating that the  economy is still in the process of bottoming out,"" said He Fan,  chief economist at Caixin Insight Group.  ""There is still pressure on maintaining growth rates, and to  realize the goal set for this year the government needs to fine  tune fiscal and monetary policies to ensure macroeconomic  stability and speed up the structural reform,"" added said.   A reading above 50 indicates expanding activity and one below 50  signals contraction.  Read MoreCaixin China PMI for  July at two-year low A breakdown of the August survey showed both the new orders  and new export orders sub-indexes declining at a faster rate than  in July – a sign of accelerating weakness in domestic and  external demand.   Recent data out of the world's second largest economy have  signaled weakening growth momentum in the second half of the  year.  A spate of economic activity data for July published earlier this  month - including industrial production, retail sales and fixed  asset investment - came in below market expectations,  underscoring the People's Bank of China's move to weaken the  yuan. Last week, the central bank surprised markets by sharply  devaluing the yuan, which the government said was part of reforms  meant to make its exchange rate more market-oriented. Bill Adams, senior international economist at PNC Financial  Services Group, said August's flash PMI reading showed that China  was adding to global inflation doldrums.  ""At the margin, this additional evidence of China's weakening  economy puts downward pressure on global prices of oil, coal,  iron ore, steel and other basic materials. China is one more  force for weak global inflation in late 2015 and 2016,"" he  said.  Adams expects China's gross domestic product (GDP) growth may  slip below 7.0 percent in the second half of 2015. The economy  grew an annual 7.0 percent in both the first and second  quarter of this year.   Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, on  the other hand, believes downside risks to growth in the  short-run are now overstated.   ""Credit growth has begun to accelerate on the back of recent  policy easing, which should feed through into stronger activity,  albeit with a lag,"" Evans-Pritchard said.  ""The fiscal stance is also set to loosen in coming months as  local governments accelerate spending to hit annual budget  targets. Finally, the government still has plenty of policy  ammunition and we think they would rather step up policy support  rather than allow growth to slip much further,"" he added."
2015-08-24,"Week Ahead: Traders look for clarity from China, Fed",0.03562269031781227,"Stocks start the week on a nervous footing, with traders looking  for signals from both China and the Fed to turn the tide.  While stocks could see a reflex pop after last week's nearly six  percent decline in the S&P 500, traders see the potential for  the first double digit decline in the S&P in four years and a  possible rocky period ahead. S&P/Capital IQ strategist Sam Stovall said the S&P 500, in fact, could see its first negative year since 2011, if it does fall into a true correction of 10 percent or more. ""Should the S&P slip into a long overdue correction  mode, it will likely take longer than year end to get back to  break even,"" said Stovall. In 2011, the S&P was just very  slightly lower, down much less than 1 percent. Before that it was  last lower in 2008. As of now, it is down 4.3 percent for the  year.  Markets have been spooked by a slowing China and traders are  watching for signs of further stimulus from China as well as  clarity from the Fed on whether a September rate hike is still  possible.   ""China's the big one. They've got to step in and do something. I  think the Fed is an issue but it's not the biggest deal. They're  damned if they do, damned if they don't,"" said Robert Doll,  Nuveen Asset Management chief equity strategist and senior  portfolio manager.  China Sunday allowed pension funds managed by local governments  to invest in its stock market for the first time. Shanghai stocks  were down nearly 12 percent last week. The Wall Street Journal  also reported that China is planning to announce more steps to  add liquidity to banks in the next several weeks, including  cutting the deposits banks are required to keep in reserve.  Stocks fell Friday in a second day of heavy selling, with the  Dow's 530-point drop the biggest one-day decline in four years.  That index is now in a 10 percent correction for the first time  since October 2011. The S&P 500 also fell sharply, blasting  through key support levels to 1970, for a one-week decline of 5.8  percent. It is now 7.7 percent off its May highs.   Markets have been worried that China's will weaken further, and  the ripple effects will continue to spread into other emerging  markets and commodities. Emerging market currencies were lower in  Asian trading early Monday, after a sharp drop in the past week.  The Mexican peso  last week was down 3.8 percent, the Malaysian ringgit was down 2.6, and the  Russian ruble was  down 6.6 percent, to name a few. Those markets have also been hit  hard by the prospect of a rising dollar and higher U.S. rates,  which would also be a setback for commodities and their  currencies.  U.S. stock futures were lower Sunday. Since Tuesday, the S&P  500 fell about 130 points, with 64 of those points on Friday  alone. Selling accelerated Wednesday, after the Fed released the  minutes of its last meeting. The markets took those minutes as  dovish and immediately began pricing out a rate hike for  September, even though the Fed indicated it was still undecided  at its July meeting. Traders say the next downside target for the  S&P 500 is now around 1950.While stocks were slammed in the past week, buyers moved into Treasurys, but the move in bond yields did not  keep pace with the sharp sell off in stocks.  Nomura rate strategist George Goncalves says bonds are not yet  exhibiting a big flight to quality trade.  ""I think the bond market into the end of next week is going to  operate on its own devices. There are some technical things with  the end of the month. It's also the end of the summer…People  don't want to get involved at these levels,"" said Goncalves.  Goncalves said Nomura expects the Fed to tighten in December but  the odds of 2016 are rising, and the odds of September are  waning.  ""You need another day or two of this volatility for people to  throw in the towel,"" he said. It would take another big swoosh  down in stocks for a major flight to quality trade to come into  the Treasury market. ""If financial conditions continue to worsen,  driving equity declines and credit widen, then the market is  doing the tightening for the Fed.""   Goncalves said market expectations for action by China may be too  high. ""There are a lot of  things the Chinese could do but  not in the short run. We're talking about an area of the world  that has a slowing economy. Their equities market has been  volatile and now they've changed their FX regime. They're doing a  lot. We can't fault the Chinese for not trying to arrest these  market changes. I think that it has to get worse for them to do  more,"" he said.  Read MoreS&P strategist:  Possible negative year for stocksYields move inversely to prices, and the yield on the 10-year yield was at 2.04 percent late Friday. Oil futures were trading lower Sunday night, after eight weeks of  declines, the longest weekly losing streak since 1986. West Texas  Intermediate futures temporarily fell below $40 per barrel Friday  but closed at $40.45 per barrel. WTI was down 4.8 percent for the  week.  The VIX, the CBOE's fear index based on put and calls  in the S&P 500, shot up to 28.03 Friday, a 47 percent jump in  one day.   ""It's hard to know how much of the (S&P) decline, at the end of the  day, was options expiration,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief market  strategist at Lindsey Group. ""You have a Friday in the summer  where nobody's going to understand what's going to happen Sunday  night in China. The market is worried about global growth.""  Traders speculated the Chinese government would intervene with a  liquidity injection or some other stimulus. The Shanghai market,  falling for weeks, was down more than 4 percent Friday after a  weak Chinese manufacturing report.  Boockvar said stocks reflect both softer global growth and  shrinking U.S. corporate earnings growth. ""The market is  adjusting to this…. The fundamental story for the U.S.  market has changed because of the Fed, the end of QE  (quantitative easing) and the potential rise in interest rates.  The major tailwinds over the last couple of years has become  headwinds. I think this correction is the beginning of something  more. Could we have violent rally? Sure, but we could also be on  the cusp of a bear market. This bull market has gone on for six  years. People should be more worried about playing defense than  picking bottoms,"" said Boockvar.  But Doll expects the market to come through the downturn and  react much like it has after all of the pullbacks since the bull  market began. ""I think the selloff is more than half way in terms  of points, but less than halfway in terms of time,"" said Doll.  Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said the  market focus will really be on the markets in the week ahead. ""Do  I think there will be some government officials around the world  who speak and that become news headlines? Yeah, but the market  becomes its own story,"" he said. ""What we will be talking about  in the absence of a big data week and because we're not in  earnings season, is really going to be where the dollar is, oil,  volatility and the 10-year and that interaction is going to  basically dominate what happens to the market. That's going to be  far more important than what happens at the company level,"" said  Golub.  Economists polled by CNBC mostly still believe the Fed will raise  rates in September, even though the market now expects it to be  later. There are several Fed speakers in the week ahead and the  important Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Fed symposium begins Thursday. Fed Chair Janet  Yellen is not attending the conference, but Fed Vice Chairman  Stanley Fischer is attending, and he speaks Saturday.  Ahead of that, New York Fed President William Dudley, viewed as  closely allied to Yellen, speaks on the regional economy  Wednesday, but he will take questions from the media. Atlanta Fed  President Dennis Lockhart speaks Monday, and his recent comments  have been viewed as hawkish since he said he saw no reason for  the Fed not to raise rates in September.  There is some important data in the week ahead, with the most  important release the personal income and spending data Friday.  There is also the revision to second quarter GDP on Thursday and  economists expect growth to increase to 3.4 percent.

2015-09-16,Layoffs needed because market is changing so rapidly: HP's Whitman,0.22241508491508494,"Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman said Wednesday the  company embarked on another round of layoffs in part because  the technology market is changing so rapidly.  ""It's remarkable what's happening to our services  business. As new technologies come in, we've got to  restructure that labor force to low-cost locations, to much more  automation than we have today,"" she told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street.""  On Tuesday, Hewlett-Packard announced it would cut 25,000 to 30,000  positions as part of its restructuring, which will split the  company into two separate firms, one focused on enterprise  services and one dedicated to its legacy hardware business.  The reductions will primarily impact workers at HP Enterprise  Services, the company's business and technology services unit. Read More Charts: Chip  stocks breaking out?  The layoffs come on top of 55,000 cuts announced in recent years  and would further reduce Hewlett-Packard's 300,000-person  workforce by about 10 percent.   The cuts over the last four years were focused on helping HP  achieve a cost structure that was in line with its revenue  trajectory, Whitman said. The reductions announced Tuesday will  help HP expand its profit margins, she added  ""These cuts are never easy, but it's the right thing to do  because we have to now get to the next phase of the HP journey,""  she said.  Whitman will serve as CEO of the services-focused Hewlett-Packard  Enterprise when it splits from its hardware business, which will  be known as HP Inc, in November.  The company expects the layoffs will save about $2.7 billion a year, though Hewlett-Packard said it will take a $2.7  billion charge to carry out the reductions. Some of those costs  will begin accruing in the fourth quarter of this year.  The company also expects the share of its workers employed  overseas in low-cost locations to grow to 60 percent by 2018 from  42 percent today.Read More  Tencent's $1.6B plan to take on Alibaba, Amazon in cloud  Whitman said the companies would return Hewlett Packard to profit  next year following the split. She had previously said that would  happen prior to the separation.  Asked what makes her confident that growth will happen this time,  she identified the separated companies' focus, their ""competitive  sharpness,"" and their ability to achieve the right capital  structure.  ""It's hard to forecast in markets that are as changing, as fast  as ours, but I think we have a good handle on this now."" she  said. ""We feel really good about our product lineup, our services  lineup, and our go-to-market strengths, which I think will stand  us in good stead for FY 16."""
2015-09-17,"Fed holds off, markets now betting on hike in 2016",0.09561113783336006,"Stocks fluctuated and bonds rallied after the Federal Reserve  held off on a first rate hike and said global economic and market  developments threaten the U.S. economy.  ""There is enough economic activity to allow the Fed to think  about raising interest rates, but there's not enough inflationary  pressure to allow them to do so,"" said Scott Clemons, chief  investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman Wealth  Management.  According to RBS, market expectations for the first full rate  hike are now priced into March, and the odds of a December hike  fell to 64 percent from 84 percent.    Read MoreFed leaves rates unchanged  ""You've taken away the threat of rate hikes,"" said John Briggs,  RBS head of strategy.  Clemons said the Fed was clearly responding to sluggishness in  China but generally pinned it on international developments in  its comments. ""I think this pushes it off until October. If  between now and October, some of these developments abroad to  which they refer—China—calm down, I think that will  pave the path for an interest rate increase in October. It pushes  out the inevitable,"" said Clemons.The Fed raised its GDP forecast to 2.1 percent growth in 2015 but cut it for 2016—to 2.3 percent from 2.5 percent. It also lowered 2017 growth to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent. Its 2015 inflation forecast fell from 0.8 percent in June to 0.4 percent, while 2016 slipped to 1.7 percent from 1.8 percent. Read More Did the  Federal Reserve make the right decision today?   The shorter end of the Treasury curve rallied hard, with yields  falling in an inverse move. The  was yielding 0.72 after holding above 0.80  percent for most of the day.  Stocks bounced around and briefly turned negative before trading became choppy. The market was slightly higher ahead of Fed Chair  Janet Yellen's  news briefing at 2:30 p.m. ET, rallied during her remarks and then closed mixed.  ""It just prolongs the uncertainty with which we've been living,""  said Clemons. When the Fed ultimately raises rates, it will be a  positive, he said. ""It will take the uncertainty off the table.""Read MoreWhen do you think the Federal Reserve will hike rates?   Mesirow Financial's chief economist, Diane Swonk, said the  most-telling aspect of the Fed release was the downward revisions  in its economic forecasts and inflation outlook, signaling real  concern about the impact of China and foreign exchange volatility  on the U.S. economy.  Two Fed officials shifted their forecast for a first rate hike  into 2016 bringing the total for next year to three. One member wants the first rate hike in 2017, and 13 remained in 2015. ""The most important thing  here is the doves grew in ranks and their voice got louder than  the hawks,"" she said. Read MoreHere's what changed in  the new Fed statement  ""It's very important we have out there now that the Fed might not  move in 2015. It's a probability now much higher than it was  before. It was going to be tough to get all their ducks in a row  by December. They'll still want to get there, but uncertainty is  not something you want to raise rates into,"" Swonk said.  ""Every central bank in the world is ultimately worried about  getting inflation too cold or too hot, and right now the porridge  is not just right.""Thursday's Fed decision was one of the most anticipated in years, since there was a reasonable chance the central bank could have raised rates were it not for its concerns about international developments. About half of Wall Street's economists expected a rate hike, even though market expectations were just about 30 percent.The Fed last raised rates nine years ago, and it has held the fed funds rate at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008."
2015-09-25,'Ex-sector' ETFs offer new way to bet on stocks,0.13055266955266956,"""I'll take the S&P, but hold the energy.""  A new set of exchange-traded funds offered by ProShares allows investors to get exposure to the entire , save for one or another given  sector. Specifically, the company now offers ETFs tracking the  S&P 500 ex-energy (trading under the ticker symbol SPXE), ex-financials  (SPXN), ex-health  care (SPXV) and  ex-technology (SPXT).   In a Thursday interview with CNBC's ""Trading Nation,"" ProShares' head of  investment strategy, Simeon Hyman, highlighted two anticipated uses  for the ETFs: diversification and tactical decision-making.  Hyman provides the example of an investor who already has high  exposure to a given sector—such as an executive compensated  in a company's stock, or an inheritor who has received a large  number of shares—and does not want to take on excess  exposure.  ""Previously you'd have to maybe call up a trust company or find  someone to run a custom strategy for you to avoid that sector,  and here it's just very straightforward: Buy an ETF. The sector's  out, it's redistributed across the other names on a  market-cap-weighted basis, you don't have to worry about it,""  Hyman said.   Second, the ETFs are designed for those who believe a given  sector, such as energy, is set to underperform the rest of the  market. ""If you have that conviction, this is a very  straightforward and easy way to effect that view,"" he said. Read More  Stocks setting up for big upside reversal: Technician  Yet given that retail investors are often considered to be  best served by buying into the overall market and avoiding  tactical calls, some say these ETFs might be an inferior play  compared to, say, SPDR's popular S&P 500 ETF (SPY).  ""As a core holding, you are far less diversified,"" Eric Mustin,  vice president of ETF trading solutions at WallachBeth Capital, wrote to CNBC. ""You are implicitly overweight the other sectors  versus the S&P 500 weightings.""  The expense ratio, at 0.27 percent, also irks Mustin.  ""You are paying nearly 200 percent to 300 percent the management  fees"" compared to a product like the (SPY), he pointed out. ""I  think it's a product that may find some success among a retail  audience, but sophisticated investors probably won't have an  appetite for it.""   Still, that extra 0.18 or so percent would have been a small  price to pay for avoiding energy over the past year, as the  sector has lost a third of its value.  When there is a ""pronounced discrepancy in attractiveness,"" such  as the clear unattractiveness of energy at the beginning of the  year given dismal earnings expectations and high valuations, ""it  would seem logical to exclude that sector,"" S&P Capital IQ's equity chief investment officer, Erin Gibbs, wrote to CNBC.    ""However, these clear-cut unattractive sector events do not  happen that often, and therefore these products could have  limited appeal,"" she added.  Yet on the bright side, ""the risk of making a really bad bet  isn't as large as compared to, say, I simply took a narrow short  position in that sector compared to nothing else,"" Hyman said.  ""Simply excluding a sector is an opportunity to perhaps make some  reasonable outperformance without betting the farm.""  And for those who are already overexposed to a given sector,  finding a way to invest in most of the market while increasing  diversification does indeed seem prudent, even if it means a  slightly higher expense ratio.Read More  Bummer: Stocks badly missing strategists' mark"
2015-09-28,Saudi Arabia withdraws overseas funds,0.03576280663780664,"Saudi Arabia has withdrawn tens of billions of dollars from  global asset managers as the oil-rich kingdom seeks to cut its  widening deficit and reduce exposure to volatile equities markets  amid the sustained slump in oil prices.  The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency's foreign reserves have slumped  by nearly $73 billion since oil prices started to decline last year as  the kingdom keeps spending to sustain the economy and fund its  military campaign in Yemen.  The central bank is also turning to domestic banks to finance a  bond programme to offset the rapid decline in reserves.  This month, several managers were hit by a new wave of  redemptions, which came on top of an initial round of withdrawals  this year, people aware of the matter said.  ""It was our Black Monday,"" said one fund manager, referring to  the large number of assets withdrawn by Saudi Arabia last week.  Institutions benefited from years of rising assets under  management from oil-rich Gulf states, but are now feeling the  pinch after oil prices collapsed last year.  Nigel Sillitoe, chief executive of financial services market  intelligence company Insight Discovery, said fund managers  estimate that Sama has pulled out $50 billion-$70 billion over  the past six months.  ""The big question is when will they come back, because managers  have been really quite reliant on Sama for business in recent  years,"" he said.  Since the third quarter of 2014, Sama's reserves held in foreign  securities have declined by $71 billion, accounting for almost  all of the $72.8 billion reduction in overall overseas  assets.  Other industry executives estimate that Sama has withdrawn even  more than $70 billion from existing managers.

By surging in Syria, Putin goes  from pariah to powerbroker  While some of this cash has been used to fund the deficit, these  executives say the central bank is also seeking to reinvest into  less risky, more liquid products.  ""They are not comfortable with their exposure to global  equities,"" said another manager.  Fund managers with strong ties to Gulf sovereign wealth funds,  such as BlackRock,  Franklin Templeton and Legal & General, have received redemption  notices, according to people aware of the matter.  Some fund managers have seen several billions of dollars of  withdrawals, or the equivalent of a fifth to a quarter of their  Saudi assets under management, the people aware of the matter  said.  Institutions such as State Street, Northern Trust and BNY Mellon have large amount of  assets under management and are therefore also likely to have  been hit hard by the Gulf governments' cash grab, the people  added.  ""We are not that surprised,"" said another fund manager. ""Sama has  been on high risk for a while and we were prepared for this.""  Sama has over the years built up a broad range of institutions  handling its funds, including other names such as Aberdeen Asset  Management, Fidelity, Invesco and Goldman Sachs. Read MoreIran leader demands Saudi Arabia apologise for hajj deaths  BlackRock, which bankers describe as the manager handling the  largest amount of Gulf funds, has already reported net outflows  from Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  Its second-quarter financial results reported a net outflow of  $24.1 billion from Emea, as opposed to an inflow of $17.7 billion  in the first quarter.  Market participants say the outflow is in part explained by  redemptions from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf sovereign funds,  such as Abu Dhabi.  BlackRock and other funds declined to comment or did not respond  to requests for comment. Sama did not respond to request for  comment."
2015-10-12,Europe needs to become 'shock-proof': Dijsselbloem,0.11867147080561712,"Europe has come a long way since the height of the economic  crisis that shook the region three years ago but it has a way to  go to become ""shock-proof,"" Eurogroup President Jeroen  Dijsselbloem told CNBC.  ""A little bit more self-confidence (is what is needed). There's  been a lot of criticism about how the euro works, how the  monetary union works and over time, since we started the monetary  union we've built it up, we've strengthened it and so I think  we're coming into a new phase now,"" the euro zone politician who  played a key role in bringing Greece back from the brink of  collapse this summer, told CNBC.  He said the euro zone's current phase was about stability and  broadening the economic and political perspectives, the  importance of which had been demonstrated by Greece's volatile  summer before Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras agreed, albeit  reluctantly, to a third bailout program.   ""Europe is coming out of a crisis. Growth has returned to all but  one of the euro zone countries and it's picking up and becoming  broader. I think we should use this current stage to become more  shock-proof,"" he told CNBC in Lima, where the International  Monetary Fund/World Bank's annual meeting was being held.   ""In order to do that we need to extend and complete the banking  union, build a capital markets union to diversify the way finance  comes to our economy and we need to push forward with the  structural reforms to become even more competitive."" Read More  Europe's crisis of confidence  ""So for Europe, it's about getting more growth, increasing  potential growth and making sure we become more shock-proof,"" he  added.  Dijsselbloem's comments come as data point to a modest recovery  in the 28-member European Union. In the second quarter of 2015,  for instance, the EU and the 19-member euro zone grew at 1.6  percent and 1.2 percent percent respectively, from the same  quarter in 2014.  Still, some of the region's biggest economies, Germany and  France, have recently shown cause for concern, with lackluster manufacturing and  service sector output and growth data. While in the second  quarter, France had no growth at all from the previous quarter,  Germany grew a meager 0.4 percent.   Dijsselbloem appeared optimistic, however, saying that current  growth rates in Europe were ""defying the pessimists"" and that  several countries such as Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands and  Baltic countries were experiencing strong levels of growth.   In order to make those growth rates sustainable, however, Europe  needed to deal with the ""hindrances"" in its economy, he said.  ""We need to cut red tape, open up markets, make sure it's easier  for people to start businesses and easier to get finance. If we  deal with all these small, structural issues in our economy then  I'm sure we can increase that potential growth with four  percentage points.""- Written by CNBC's Holly Ellyatt, follow her on Twitter @HollyEllyatt.

2015-10-14,Netflix earnings: Street looks for signs of global traction,0.05044483294483294,"The media industry's current mantra is ""content is king"" but for  analysts watching Netflix this week, subscribers are  king — more specifically international subscribers.   When Netflix reports third-quarter results Wednesday evening,  it's expected to post a 43 percent decline in earnings per share,  while sales are forecast to rise 24 percent, but the real story  about the state of its global expansion.   The streaming giant has laid down roots in hosts of new markets, most  recently Japan in the third quarter, and it plans to expand  further into Europe during the fourth quarter. Wall Street will  undoubtedly be looking for signs that the expansion is gaining  traction.   Analyst are bullish on second-half subscriber growth and the  company is widely expected to surpass its guidance  of 3.55 million net additions — consisting of 2.4 million  additional international subscribers and an additional 1.15  million domestically.   In a research earlier this week, Michael Nathanson, media analyst at MoffattNathanson, said Netflix could add 4.2 million new subscribers,  including 1.5 million domestic and 2.7 million international,  which would bring the company's total paid subscriber base to a  record 67 million.  On average, Wall Street is looking for 1.19 million U.S. net  additions and 2.46 million net additions internationally,  according to StreetAccount estimates.   ""The U.S. has always gotten the focus, in terms of subscriber  growth, but we're seeing international starting to become more  and more of a factor,"" said Tuna Amobi, senior media and  entertainment analyst at S&P Capital IQ. ""I think  international is really starting to pay off, especially since  they've ramped up the launches in the last 18 to 24  months.""  Read MoreAnalysts love the  Netflix price hike  Netflix's international business has been drag on its  profitability as it has increased spending on original content.  The company said it expects to generate material profit on the  global front in 2017 following ""peak international losses"" in  2016. The company hopes to be fully global by the end  of 2016.   Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect the Los Gatos,  California-based company to post net income of 8 cents a share, a  decrease of 43 percent from the same three-month period last  year, while revenue is forecast to rise 24 percent to $1.75  billion.    Notably, the company's DVD-by-mail segment, a relic of its  original business model, is projected to contribute $74 million  in profit, nearly making up for the $77.7 million loss expected  from its international streaming business, according to  StreetAccount. The dwindling U.S. DVD business served 5.3 million  members in the second quarter and provided about $78 million in  contribution to profit, while the international steaming segment  lost $77 million.    ""We've seen more spending on content and I think [earnings]  expectations are tempered due to the losses related to the  international business,"" Amobi said, ""I think it's going to pay  off in terms of viewing hours ... they don't break out viewing  hours, but every time they have the trends have been very  strong."" Read More Will this  become the 'Netflix of sports'?  In a note Tuesday, Nomura pointed to Netflix's recent price  increases in Europe and the U.S. as evidence of the company's  confidence in the ""inelasticity of Netflix demand.""    ""We believe the decision to raise prices in the U.S., Canada and  parts of Latin America in 4Q were in part motivated by 3Q's  success in Europe and management's overall confidence in the  subscriber growth trajectory,"" Nomura said.   Last week, Netflix increased the price of its most popular  streaming plan for new members by $1 to $9.99 per month.   Investment firm Wedbush said the price hikes reflect increasing  content costs — as opposed to pricing power.   Netflix is inarguably the streaming market leader, taking about  38 percent of the U.S. video-on-demand market, followed by Amazon  with 14 percent and Hulu with 7 percent, according to NPOWER and  Nielsen research, which excludes broadband-only subscribers.       The company's growing domination of the streaming market has some  traditional media outlets re-evaluating their licensing  partnerships with Netflix — which could be a threat to  its library of content down the line.   Read MoreBattle for  pay-TV subscribers hits the playground  ""Already during the September conference circuit, we have heard  some media executives, most notably at 21st Century Fox and Time  Warner, become more vocal against selling content to Netflix,  which now has 42 million subscribers in the U.S. and has been  labeled the main culprit behind TV ratings declines,"" Nathanson  wrote in a note earlier this week.  Media stocks were battered in August as investors appeared to  lose faith as fears intensified about customers scaling back on  traditional cable packages after Disney trimmed its forecast for TV  subscriber-fee profit growth because of subscriber losses at its  flagship ESPN sports network.    Traditional cable companies are still worried about cord cutting,  but a big pop in Netflix's third-quarter subscriber growth  doesn't necessarily mean that cord cutting has accelerated,  according to S&P's Amobi.   ""Cord cutting is definitely an issue; however I don't think it's  such an issue right now to become overly concerned that somehow  Netflix is going to dominate the overall television landscape,  Amobi said.

2015-10-20,HK's white collar workers have a dim view of 2016,0.05744408369408373,"Political tension with Beijing, high property prices, and an economic slowdown in mainland China have dimmed Hong  Kong's growth outlook for 2016 according to the city's white  collar workers, a new study has found.Professional accounting body CPA Australia, which polled Hong  Kong-based professionals working in public and private companies,  government and other not-for-profit organizations, found 53  percent of respondents described themselves as pessimistic about  the region's prospects – a 13 percent increase in gloomy  respondents compared to the year before. Just 9 percent said they saw the economic outlook as ""positive,""  while 34 percent said it was satisfactory.Almost a third believed Hong Kong's gross domestic product (GDP),  the widest measure of economic growth, would expand by between  1-1.9 percent next year; this was a 7 percent decline in the  number that expected similarly positive growth in the CPA's 2014  poll. According to the new poll, 25 percent said GDP growth would  decline in 2016, a 13 percent rise in the number of pessimistic  votes on the year preceding.   ""There is no doubt that the survey results show that economic  sentiment for 2016 has turned negative and many respondents  believe our competitiveness is declining,"" Kenneth Chen,  divisional president of greater China at CPA Australia, said in a  press release.   The main threats to Hong Kong's competitiveness were seen as  coming from mainland China, despite the volatility that affected  Chinese markets in the third quarter, and from Singapore, the CPA  Australia study found. About 67 percent of the respondents  thought Hong Kong's competitiveness will decline in  2016.   Last month, the World Economic Forum (WEF) ranked Hong Kong  seventh in its Global Competitiveness Index, while Singapore  ranked second and China was 28th. Hong Kong has been ranked in  the same place for three straight years, with the latest report  noting ""the challenge for Hong Kong is to evolve from one of the  world's foremost financial hubs to an innovative powerhouse.""  Hong Kong scored low marks for innovation.   The downbeat view of Hong Kong's outlook is echoed by some  analysts and economists.  Rajiv Biswas, chief economist for Asia Pacific at IHS Global  Insight, told CNBC by email: ""Hong Kong is particularly  vulnerable to an economic slowdown in China, due to the  increasingly close economic ties with the mainland."" He added  that the impact of China's growth slowdown was already visible in  Hong Kong's economic data.   Hong Kong's total merchandise exports fell by 1 percent on-year  in the first eight months of  2015; exports to China were  down by 2.2 percent. And slow growth in tourism from the mainland  hit Hong Kong's retail sales, which clocked a 5.4 percent  year-on-year decline in August.   Read MoreHas Hong Kong lost its  center of vice?  ""In recent months, mainland tourism visits to Hong Kong have  shown a dramatic slump, with total mainland Chinese tourist  arrivals in August down [by] 7.1 [percent] compared to a year  ago,"" said Biswas.  An economic slowdown, along with crackdown on corruption on the  mainland, also affected sales of luxury brands in Hong  Kong.   ""Sales of [luxury] watches and jewelry in Hong Kong [was] down  8.8 [percent] year-on-year in August 2015,"" Biswas noted.  But some believe that for an advanced economy, the projected GDP  figures are acceptable.    In a July report on Hong Kong's outlook, Moody's Analytics said  that though the region's growth was expected to come in between 1  and 3 percent for the coming two years, the projected figure was  ""still robust for an advanced, high income economy.""   ""Hong Kong has significant buffers to guard against financial and  economic shocks,"" the report noted, citing the region's strong  fiscal reserves and international investment position.  In a September report, Moody's issued a revised forecast for Hong  Kong's growth outlook to 2.2 percent for 2016.   Even sometimes tense political relations with Beijing were  ""unlikely to affect economic policies or result in political  protests of a scale that could hinder growth or dent Hong Kong's  status as an international financial center,"" Moody's July report  noted. Read MoreHong Kong's cultural hotspots you may not know about  In June Hong Kong's legislature rejected a Beijing-supported  electoral bill that proposed Hong Kong residents should vote for  their next leader from a list of candidates approved by the  Chinese government.  The CPA Australia study said that closer economic collaboration  with China would help Hong Kong's economy overcome the negative  outlook currently prevalent, especially in sectors such as  e-commerce, healthcare, banking and finance.   ""China has introduced a number of policies and initiatives that  will undoubtedly help drive economic growth in Hong Kong,' noted  Chen.   Beijing has used a number of fiscal and monetary policies to  stabilize its stock markets and keep growth on track, as well as  launching initiatives to establish closer business and trade ties  with countries in the region.    These initiatives include the new Asian Infrastructure Investment  Bank (AIIB), the Belt and Road initiative, which aims to be one  of the largest trade and infrastructure networks connecting the  Asia Pacific and Europe, and free trade zones."
2015-10-22,Lululemon's product chief to leave in organizational shuffle,0.07627474747474747,"Lululemon Athletica said on Wednesday that its chief product  officer is leaving after just two years with the premium yogawear  retailer, which has struggled in recent months with narrowing  margins and supply-chain hiccups.Tara Poseley, a former Kmart executive who was hired by Lululemon  in October 2013, will leave ""after a transition period"" and her  role will be eliminated, the Vancouver-based company said.Poseley replaced Sheree Waterson, who departed earlier that year  amid a backlash over the high profile recall of overly sheer yoga  pants and concerns about product quality.  Analysts had lofty expectations for Poseley, who joined up a  couple months ahead of new chief executive Laurent Potvin, and  shares in the yogawear maker, which plunged through the end of  2013, climbed back up in 2014.  But supply-chain woes, concerns over dwindling margins and  another recall has pushed the stock back down in recent  months.  Lululemon, which said the leadership changes are aimed at  reinforcing its brand, also announced a new creative director  role, geared at bringing the design of the men's and women's  product lines under the same organizational umbrella.  Lee Holman, who joined Lululemon in 2014 from Nike, was named to  the newly-created executive vice president, creative director  post.  Chief Financial Officer Stuart Haselden will gain broader  responsibilities, including heading up operations, and the  company has also created a new, still unfilled, chief supply  chain officer role.  Analysts last month questioned Lululemon's margins, which have  dwindled as the company has faced higher costs associated with  its international expansion.  The company has also been hit hard by a series of quality lapses,  including the high profile recall of overly sheer yoga pants in  2013 and a more recent recall of women's tops due to injury risks  from their drawstrings."
2015-11-24,Google now wants to get you the best mortgage,0.17998955067920583,"Technology behemoth Google has expanded its fleet of financial  services this week by offering homebuyers in California the  opportunity to compare and contrast mortgages.  Its online comparison tool has now been expanded to provide  information on housing loans after first announcing the idea in  May.  ""Buying a home is a major financial decision — so when it  comes to getting a mortgage, people want an easy way to  understand and compare their options online,"" Google said in a  blogpost on its news site Monday.  Google predicted that nearly one in two borrowers still don't  shop around for their mortgage and set up the tool to help people  make ""more informed financial decisions."" It said that it would  be rolled out to more U.S. states after launching in California.  ""Whether you're a national lender or one local to California,  people searching for mortgages on their smartphone or desktop  computer can now find you, along with a real-time,  apples-to-apples comparison of rate quotes from other lenders  — all in as little as a minute,"" it added.  The move follows on from a mortgage calculator tool that launched  in February this year. The new services have actually been  available in the U.K. for a number of years, where the property  industry - and its regulation - is very different with a surfeit  of similar tools all competing in the market.   The U.K. version of the general comparison tool - which includes  car and travel insurance - states that 51 percent of users could  save up to £205.26 ($310) with Google Compare and 80  percent of consumers could save up to £74.54, citing online  independent research by analysis group Consumer Intelligence this  year.  ""Digital channels and digital strategies are of huge interest to  the mortgage industry,"" Sue Anderson, the head of member and  external relations at the U.K.'s Council of Mortgage Lenders,  told CNBC via email.  However, she added that the recent direction of travel in terms  of regulation in U.K. – specifically, the provision of  advice – has not tended to favor these digital strategies.  ""Many lenders are seeking to establish how best to approach the  needs of the tech-savvy generation who prefer online purchasing  and account management,"" she added."
2015-12-27,China passes controversial counter-terrorism law,-0.0017702535559678313,"China's parliament passed a controversial new anti-terrorism law  on Sunday that requires technology firms to hand over sensitive  information such as encryption keys to the government and allows  the military to venture overseas on counter-terror operations.  Chinese officials say their country faces a growing threat from  militants and separatists, especially in its unruly Western  region of Xinjiang, where hundreds have died in violence in the  past few years.  The law has attracted deep concern in Western capitals, not only  because of worries it could violate human rights such as freedom  of speech, but because of the cyber provisions. U.S. President  Barack Obama has said that he had raised concerns about the law  directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping.  Speaking after China's largely rubber-stamp parliament passed the  law, Li Shouwei, deputy head of the parliament's criminal law  division under the legislative affairs committee, said China was  simply doing what other Western nations already do in asking  technology firms to help fight terror.  ""This rule accords with the actual work need of fighting  terrorism and is basically the same as what other major countries  in the world do,"" Li told reporters.  This will not affect the normal operation of tech companies and  they have nothing to fear in terms of having ""backdoors""  installed or losing intellectual property rights, he added.  Officials in Washington have argued the law, combined with new  draft banking and insurance rules and a slew of anti-trust  investigations, amounts to unfair regulatory pressure targeting  foreign companies.  China's national security law adopted in July requires all key  network infrastructure and information systems to be ""secure and  controllable"".  The anti-terrorism law also permits the People's Liberation Army  to get involved in anti-terrorism operations overseas, though  experts have said China faces big practical and diplomatic  problems if it ever wants to do this.  An Weixing, head of the Public Security Ministry's  counter-terrorism division, said China faced a serious threat  from terrorists, especially ""East Turkestan"" forces, China's  general term for Islamists separatists it says operate in  Xinjiang.  ""Terrorism is the public enemy of mankind, and the Chinese  government will oppose all forms of terrorism,"" An said.  Rights groups, though, doubt the existence of a cohesive militant  group in Xinjiang and say the unrest mostly stems from anger  among the region's Muslim Uighur people over restrictions on  their religion and culture.  The new law also restricts the right of media to report on  details of terror attacks, including a provision that media and  social media cannot report on details of terror activities that  might lead to imitation, nor show scenes that are ""cruel and  inhuman""."

2016-01-25,Driverless cars will become like your iPhone: Carmakers,0.203951367781155,"The driverless car will become like your mobile phone: Something  that you'll much rather own than hire, leading carmakers told  CNBC as they face the threat that ride-sharing apps such as Uber  could disrupt the autonomous car space.   Last year, Uber, the world's most valuable start-up, announced it  was developing autonomous vehicles. If you could order a  self-driving taxi at the tap of a button, why would car ownership  be necessary?   But two major auto giants aren't worried and said that while Uber  will enjoy great success, the connected car will become a  consumer device that people will want to own.  ""If you think that you have a car only for mere cold  transportation, then you can take bus, you can take a taxi, and  Uber is going to develop the taxi system…then yes, right,  you don't need to buy a car,"" Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive  of Renault-Nissan, said during a CNBC technology event at Davos  last week.   ""But people use a car for many other things and with the  connectivity coming, the car is going to become a kind of working  space, it's going to become a living space. Because if in the car  you can connect, interface, video conference… it becomes  your own space, you're going to have your own photos, your own  email, your own music, your own calls, your own everything, it  becomes like your iPhone, you want something belonging to you.""  As well as the connected experience of cars, the use cases will continue to differ in the future. While Uber  might be useful for ""megacities"" in which parking and congestion  is a problem, other areas will still see car ownership continue,  according to one Volvo Cars executive.   ""You have a different transportation need when you go from the  cities to the suburban areas and if you go to the countryside you  have a different transportation need. And I think this is also  part of the development of the automotive industry and  ecosystem…addressing various needs from the consumer  perspective,"" Klas Bendrik, chief information officer at Volvo  Cars, told CNBC.    Volvo recently struck a partnership with Microsoft to use the  U.S. company's HoloLens augmented reality headsets in its  showrooms to help people buy and develop driverless car  technology.   Analysts and carmakers are optimistic on the prospects of  autonomous vehicles. Juniper Research forecasts almost 20 million  fully autonomous or self-driving vehicles on the road by 2025,  with consumer adoption set to take off in 2021.  Some however are predicting a much quicker adoption. Recently,  Tesla boss Elon Musk said the company's cars could pick you up by  themselves from the other side of the country by 2018.   But not all share Musk's very short timeline. Ghosn said that  while Renault is testing autonomous vehicles in Palo Alto,  California, regulation and reliability of the cars could stop  them getting into consumers' hands any time soon.  ""I'm a little bit skeptical when a carmaker…says we are  going to be able to sell cars, autonomously driven, before 2020,  in 2018, when the regulation is not ready. And we know the  technology is still in a prototype phase,"" Ghosn said."
2016-02-05,Buy Apple—the bulls will win this ‘war’: Trader,0.1101641414141414,"After three tough months for Apple, the tech giant is finally finding a bottom,  according to one trader.   Apple shares are down more than 20 percent since November due to concerns about slowing iPhone sales and a  difficult economic environment in China. But that selling makes  this the ideal time to make a bullish play on the stock,  according to Andrew Keene of AlphaShark.  Keene believes that new products will give Apple a much-needed  boost. Keene also noted that the company is still holding plenty  of cash.  ""In the short term, we might get some volatility, ... [but] it is  starting to consolidate here,"" Keene said Thursday on CNBC's  ""Trading Nation.""  ""This is a tug of war between the bulls and the bears to see who  wins.""  And Keene says the bulls now have the edge.Read More  Why traders are betting on a big bounce for the metals  ""By 2017, I think Apple can march its way back to up to the  highs, just like Facebook did, up to that $115 level,"" he  said.   To make a bullish trade, Keene is buying the January 2017  105-strike call and selling the January 115-strike call for a  total cost of $2.50 per share, which is an options strategy known  as a ""bull call spread."" Keene sees maximum profits if Apple  rises to $115 by January expiration, but the trade is profitable  if Apple shares rise to $107.50 by that time. Below that level,  his losses are capped at the amount spent on the trade.  A jump to $107.50 would be a 12 percent move for Apple's stock,  which traded around $96 on Friday morning.

2016-03-10,"China Feb inflation +2.3% on-year, fastest rise since July 2014",0.02059314070941979,"Consumer prices in the world's second-largest economy accelerated  to a six-month high in February as seasonal distortions caused  food prices to spike.  Consumer price inflation rose 2.3 percent from a year ago, faster  than January's 1.8 percent rise and well above Reuters  expectations for 1.9 percent rise. February's expansion was the  fastest annual pace of growth since July 2014, Reuters said.  February's spike was only a temporary effect, warned Grace Ng, greater China economist at J.P Morgan.  ""Part of the increase is due to Chinese New Year-related issues.  Generally, the inflation picture overall is quite tame. For the  whole year, we're still looking for inflation below 2 percent,""  she told CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""  The week-long Lunar New Year holiday that began on February 7  tends to increase demand for fresh food every year, which pushes up prices. Unusual cold weather this year also caused a tightening in the  supply of vegetables, driving prices higher, according to a  Societe Generale note.  Despite the surge, inflation isn't expected to continue  accelerating.""We think it would take a big food supply shock or energy price  spike for CPI inflation to cross the central bank's 3 percent  inflation red line,"" said Tim Condon, head of Asia research  at ING.  Meanwhile, February producer prices tanked 4.9 percent on year,  slower than January's 5.3 percent and in line with estimates.  This marks the fourth consecutive year of Chinese  firms slashing prices of their goods, according to Reuters.  ""What's worrying is the PPI deflation trend as that impacts  company profits and sales revenue. Considering the fact that the  corporate sector is the most leveraged among economic players in  terms of financial risk, it's a difficult situation,""  Ng  said.  Asian markets were mixed following the data, with  the Shanghai Composite down nearly 1 percent and the Australian dollar, a proxy for China  plays, modesty lower at $0.7470.  ""The 18 percent month-on-month drop in global crude prices in  January ensured that deep PPI deflation will persist until global  oil prices stabilize long enough for a low-base effect to kick  in, which would be toward the end of the year,"" said Condon.  ""Deep PPI deflation squeezes cash flows in China's  highly-leveraged corporates and calls for lower interest rates.  We expect the PBOC to cut  policy interest rates by 25 basis  points.""  —Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook."
2016-03-16,Gerber: Don't miss out on this huge opportunity in oil,0.12746212121212122,"If you're an investor avoiding the oil space, you could be  missing out on the best opportunity in years.  That's what one veteran investment manager is arguing —  comparing the oil  glut to the opportunity presented to investors during the depths of the housing crisis.   ""There is enormous opportunity in the oil area. We are doing a  lot of research there. We look at it kind of like housing in  2010,"" Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and  Investment Management , said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Futures Now.""   In the past six years, the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF has rallied by  more than 100 percent. Gerber believes the oil sector could  be positioning itself for similar gains.  ""The market has been totally beholden to oil over the last three  to six months. ... We're exiting a period where we feared total  devastation in the oil patch leading to bankruptcies and  defaults,"" he said, even as volatility continues to grip the area. ""It's only the beginning of the fixing of this process.""  Crude oil, which has surged by nearly 25 percent in the past  eight weeks, has been under pressure again this week due to  oversupply concerns. But it's not discouraging Gerber from  sticking to his bullish case.  ""The supply and demand imbalance still exists currently. But we've seen some supply come off the market, and we've seen an increase in demand, which has created a little more of a perception of stability,"" he said. ""We think oil will probably sit around the $40 to $45 which we're fine with. It's the best benefit to the economy and the oil producers can continue to exist."""
2016-03-16,Street to take second look at Fed,0.06451058201058202,"The Fed will likely remain in the spotlight Thursday as a  handful of secondary data reports are the major events on the  calendar.   ""I think barring any huge surprise in the jobs data tomorrow, I  think a lot of tomorrow will be spillover from what the Fed had  to say,"" said Myles Clouston, senior director at Nasdaq Advisory  Services.   ""My sense is a lot of investors feel like they're walking on  eggshells right now. They're waiting for the next data point to  come out,"" he said.   The data releases due Thursday include Fed Chair Janet Yellen's preferred  indicator on the labor market, the Job Openings and Labor  Turnover Survey for January.   ""The labor market data now is somewhat secondary to the inflation  data because we're near full employment,"" said Eric Stein,  co-director of global fixed income at Eaton Vance  Management.   Recent economic reports have showed signs of inflation picking  up. The Labor Department on Wednesday said the consumer price  index, ex-food and energy, rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months  through February, Reuters reported.  However, in her news conference Wednesday afternoon, Yellen said,  ""There may be some transitory factors influencing"" the recent  rise in inflation.

Other U.S. economic reports due Thursday include weekly jobless  claims, the Philadelphia Fed survey for March, February leading  indicators and fourth-quarter current account data.   Stocks rallied cautiously Wednesday after the Federal Reserve  kept rates unchanged and lowered its projection to two hikes in  2016, down from four. Most analysts had expected a drop to  three.  U.S. crude oil  futures jumped 5.8 percent, or $2.12, to settle at $38.46 a  barrel Wednesday, helped by the Fed news, a smaller-than-expected  inventory build and the announcement of a meeting to discuss a  proposal to freeze output.

2016-03-22,Brussels attacks may sway Brexit vote: Strategists,0.000981620718462821,"European stocks, especially the transportation sector, were  declining, in the wake of Tuesday's terrorist attacks at the main  Brussels airport and a metro station near European Union  buildings.  Nandini Ramakrishnan, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset  Management, told CNBC's ""Worldwide Exchange"" the blasts were likely to dampen  a key driver of Europe's recovery.  ""I think there's a larger story here, where these types of events  do affect consumer sentiment,"" Ramakrishnan said. ""We're worried  about consumer discretionary sectors, which have been really  pioneering the European recovery.""  European airlines stocks fell after news of explosions. Air  France, for example, was down about 4 percent. Travel on small  commercial flights, which Europe is known for, is likely to  continue slowing as fears about terrorism reignite, Ramakrishnan  said.  ""[But] markets are a bit more resilient than we think, people are  still waiting to see as the news develops,"" she said. ""It's very  difficult for traders and investors to position themselves in any  way for something like this.""  The attacks in Brussels could impact the so-called ""Brexit""  referendum in June, said Ramakrishnan. ""An event like today  certainly does push the case for certain campaign language for  the U.K. to leave the EU a bit further.""  Ramakrishnan sees shakiness in U.K. equities, because of investor  indecision on whether to put money into companies that rely on  the close relationship with the European Union.""We're in a bit of a wait-and-see mode,"" she added. ""The  uncertainties could certainly affect markets in a negative way.""  Ben Emons, managing director and portfolio manager at Leader  Capital, was also clear about Tuesday's attacks influencing this summer's vote on whether the U.K. should exit the EU.""The security of Europe continues to be in question,"" Emons  told ""Worldwide Exchange"" in a separate interview. ""Political  pressure is clear and this will only fuel your skeptics.""  The dollar has weakened against a basket of currencies over the  past few weeks but the index was reversing slightly Tuesday. Emons said the trend is this is likely  to continue. ""I think the dollar takes some of the weakness back and just gets  strength in a day like this.""Economic surveys out of Belgium, he said, are key consumer indicators  for the rest of Europe.

2016-05-18,Rate hike odds spike across the board after Fed minutes,0.1279040404040404,"Expectations for a June rate hike jumped as Federal Reserve meeting minutes released Wednesday showed that members would support it if  economic data improved.  Ahead of the release, market  expectations for a rate rise next month were 19 percent, while  the markets were expecting the first rate hike of 2016 to  take place in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.  After the statement, odds rose in all months tracked by CME: June: 34 percent chance, up from 19 percent before the 2  p.m. EDT release July: 51 percent chance, up from 38 percent   September: 63 percent, up from 57 percent   November: 65 percent, up from 60 percent   December: 77 percent, up from 74 percent   February 2017: 79 percent, up from 76 percent    The odds of rate hikes this year have risen broadly this week, as  several Fed officials delivered hawkish remarks.   On Tuesday, three central bank officials indicated it may  raise rates again soon.  Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said the U.S. economy is  strong enough to justify an interest rate hike in the ""not too  distant future,"" but increases will be very gradual.  San Francisco Fed President John Williams and Atlanta Fed  President Dennis Lockhart both said the central bank's June  meeting was a ""live"" one.  In Fed jargon, a ""live"" meeting is one at which officials could  debate whether to raise their benchmark short-term interest rate,  which since December has been in a range between 0.25 and  0.50 percent. — Reuters contributed to this report."

""You'll notice that after that disastrous 38,000 jobs added [in  May], you saw big moves up in the commodities space and a move  down in the dollar,"" Todd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com told  CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Monday. ""That's reflecting the Fed  sitting on the beach on their hands for the summer.""  Gordon took a look at the market overall and identified the lead  sectors kicking off the week on Monday. While the S&P 500 is  up, he noted that the leading sectors in the marketplace appear  to be industrials, materials and energy, with oil leading the  way. Crude was up more than one percent midday.   The trend has Gordon willing to bet on the oil and gas production  ETF (XOP) breaking through to new highs. More specifically,  Gordon believes that the XOP is actually set to break above the  $37 mark and has set $36.50 as the key level to watch for in the  next coming days.  If the XOP does move to $36.50, Gordon predicts that oil will  keep moving up.  ""If we can get up to the $36.50 mark, it looks like XOP, along  with crude oil, should be able to move up through the next  several days,"" Gordon said."
2016-06-30,Amazon gives shoppers a glimpse at its Prime Day deals,0.05454158936301794,"Amazon has finally  lifted the lid on its second-annual Prime Day sale, which it's  touting as the ""biggest Amazon event ever.""  On July 12, the online retailer will offer Prime members new  deals as often as every five minutes. That compares with a new  deal every 10 minutes during last year's Prime Day. In all, the  sale will include more than 100,000 deals spanning ""nearly all  departments and categories,"" from televisions to vitamins. Amazon  did not provide a comparable number of items for last year's  event, but said this is the largest number of deals it's offered  in a single day.  The U.S. sale will kick off at 3 a.m. Eastern for existing Prime  members, as well as those who sign up that day for one of its  paid memberships or free 30-day trial. Unlike last year, Amazon  will offer a handful deals for Prime members in the week leading  up to Prime Day, on items including a 32-inch TV bundled with a  Fire TV Stick, which will sell for $119.99.   ""Following last year's record sales, we have dramatically  increased the inventory behind many deals,"" said Greg Greeley,  vice president of Amazon Prime. That includes nearly double the  number of TV units in stock as compared with Black Friday and  Cyber Monday combined. Last year, some shoppers  complained on social media that the deals were selling out too  quickly.  Amazon's Prime Day playbook is similar to its Black Friday  strategy, which also rolled out deals every five minutes. Company  spokeswoman Julie Law said some of the discounts will be deeper than  last year's event.  During its inaugural Prime Day sale, held last July in honor of  the company's 20th anniversary, Amazon sold more units than on  Black Friday 2014, which at the time was its biggest ever  (Amazon's 2015 Black Friday event surpassed that metric). In  addition to driving sales, the event led to more new members  trying Prime than on any day in its history, Amazon said.  Though Amazon does not release information regarding the number  of Prime members, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners  estimates Amazon has 54 million U.S. members. The firm's data also  shows that 73 percent of Amazon's 30-day trial subscribers pay for  the first full year of membership. And 91 percent of first-year  subscribers renew for a second year, CIRP said.  Amazon has not set an explicit goal for this year's event, though the company expects it to be ""another record-breaking  Prime Day,"" Law said. She said additional details regarding specific Prime  Day deals will be released closer to the event, including ""far  more"" limited-time lightning deals and deals of the day. Shoppers last year also grumbled on social media that the discounts were not as deep as they had expected, and that some of the items on sale seemed strange. One deal, for example, promoted a chef's hat.  Law responded to criticism that the Prime Day discounts at times  seem random, saying the event is different from Black Friday in  that it's not a gifting holiday. Instead, it's the time of year  when shoppers are stocking up on such things as seasonal summer  goods and back-to-school essentials, she said.  ""What could be weird to one person may be wonderful to someone  else,"" Law said. ""We really stand behind the deals we had last  year and the deals we have this year.""  Amazon's announcement, while widely expected, comes one day after  Wal-Mart announced  a free 30-day trial  for its ShippingPass service, which is positioned as a  competitor to Prime. Similar to Amazon Prime, Wal-Mart shoppers  can pay an annual fee to receive unlimited two-day  shipping.   Wal-Mart's version of the service costs $49 a year, compared to  $99 for an annual Prime subscription. However, Prime membership  includes additional benefits that aren't part of Wal-Mart's  program, including unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows.  Amazon also boasts a broader array of products, with more than 20  million items eligible for Prime. Walmart's U.S. site has roughly  7 million items up for grabs."

2016-07-21,Mike Pence saved the Republican party after that Cruz disaster,0.15774103613777526,"Ted Cruz essentially gave a career-ending  speech at the GOP convention on Wednesday night.   Cruz's speech was a slap in the face to GOP nominee Donald Trump.  This whole business about ""vote your conscience"" — that's a  wonderful-sounding phrase. But we all know what he meant: Don't  vote for Donald Trump.   I was in the convention hall and the crowd's reaction was  unbelievable. It started out as a few hands waving in the air and  some booing and then it just grew and grew throughout the entire  convention hall. And then boom! It was absolute bedlam.  I've been to most of the GOP conventions since 1980, and I've  never seen anything like it. These people stood on their feet and  booed. These are Republicans! They don't do this. They don't know  how to stand up and boo! And yet, Cruz so divided them and worked  them into such a frenzy that it happened.  Cruz tried to pass it off as just the New York delegation acting  up. But that is wrong. The whole hall was in an uproar. You  couldn't even hear the last two paragraphs of Cruz's speech  because the booing had reached such a crescendo!  Cruz left an absolute disaster in his wake when he finished that  speech. Everyone was dispirited — as you might expect.  And then came Trump running mate Mike Pence.  Pence delivered a terrific speech. He touched on all the major  themes — the economy, shaking up Washington and Trump being  an outsider. He talked about how Trump understands that middle  class wage earners have been hurt — they haven't had a raise  in 15 years. That's something that Cruz, in all of his years of  political experience, still doesn't understand!  Really, in the space of about 10 or 12 minutes, Mike Pence turned  a demoralized, dispirited, depressed, negative convention into an  upbeat, optimistic, united convention. He hit all the right notes  and had a lot of optimism in his speech. The Cruz disaster, that  had left the convention hall spinning just moments before, was  suddenly swept away.  The entire hall started applauding Pence. Then they started  cheering for Pence. And they got on their feet and cheered for  Pence. Amazing.  Trump couldn't have made a better choice. Mike Pence  single-handedly pulled that convention back together and united  them with an optimistic message. He gave great support to Donald  Trump and the ticket. He basically snatched victory from the jaws  of defeat. He turned destruction into positive hope.  I've never seen anything like that.  Ted Cruz will never politically recover from this. His delegation  from Texas wanted him to play ball with Trump — and he  wouldn't. He was freelancing in that speech. And that is why his  political career is over. He's finished.  But Donald Trump and Mike Pence are just beginning.  We have to wait and see what Trump does tonight in his speech  — it could make or break his presidential campaign. I  personally hope that he puts a lot of focus on optimistic,  positive changes for America. I want to see a lot of growth in  that speech. I want to hear him talk about lowering taxes and  curbing regulations.   But here's what I want to see most of all: a follow-through from what Pence started. One of Pence's messages on Wednesday night was that we,  meaning the ticket, can turn this nation around. It's an American malaise right now — from the economy, to civil unrest, violence and the threat of terrorism. And that is what Trump must prove to the nation and the world — that he can turn it around. He's got to convince  them.  It's kind of like Reagan redux. Ronald Reagan was able to do  this. He proved that he could do the job. That's what Trump needs  to do.  That's huge. That's more important than any policy detail.  That's the spirit that Pence started on Wednesday night. Let's  hope Trump does the same.   Commentary by Larry Kudlow, a senior contributor at CNBC and  economics editor of the National Review.

2016-09-09,"Forget the Brexit 'noise,' these are the real risks Europe faces",0.04037834311806917,"The political and economic ""noise"" created by the U.K.'s decision  to leave the European Union is masking a ""large number"" of risks  in Europe, according to the region's political experts.""A large number of material political risks in southern and core  Europe are being masked by the noise emanating from Brexit,""  Mujtaba Rahman, managing director of Europe at political risk  consultancy Eurasia Group, said in a note Thursday.He and his team were not alone, with other political risk  consultancies remarking on the fact that Brexit could in fact be  the least of Europe's worries. Here's CNBC's collection of  Europe's top ten upcoming risk events, according to analysts.Greece's economic crisis reached a peak in the summer of 2015  when it was forced, by impending bankruptcy, to accept a third 86  billion euro ($96.9 billion) bailout package from international  lenders.  A year on and Greece is facing an uphill struggle to meet the  conditions of its latest bailout. ""The economic and political  challenges across southern Europe continue to increase,""  according to Eurasia Group's Rahman. (103880026) ""While Greece  will of course struggle, the debate between (main political  party) Syriza and its creditors is no different to the one that  took place last year. As such, Greece is in something of a  Groundhog Day.""Spain's economy might be booming compared to its euro zone peers  (it expanded more than Germany, France and Italy in the second  quarter of this year). However, an ongoing political impasse in  the country threatens to derail that growth, with the country  potentially facing a third general election in 12 months by the  end of the year.  ""A third round of elections remains the most probable scenario  (55 percent probability),"" according to Antonio Barroso, deputy  director of research at political risk consultancy Teneo  Intelligence. ""Short of an internal revolt within the PSOE  (Socialist party) or a deal between the ruling People's Party  (PP) and Basque nationalists (which would allow a government to  be formed).""Aside from national political deadlock in Spain, the question of  Catalonia's independence movement rumbles on. The separatist  movement in the wealthy north Spanish state has long been a thorn  in the side of Madrid and that clash is set to continue, Teneo's  Barroso warned.  ""Catalan authorities will likely approve again further measures  to advance towards the creation of an independent state, which  will promptly be challenged legally by Madrid. Therefore, the  clash between Madrid and the Catalan authorities is likely to  intensify in the coming months,"" he said.Italy's banking system seems to have avoided going into meltdown  this summer despite fears over the estimated 360 billion euros  worth of non-performing loans on its banks' books. But it's the  country's political system that is now at risk with Prime  Minister Matteo Renzi facing a referendum on reforms in October  which, if he loses, could see him resign. This would leave the  country in limbo in terms of leadership and economic reforms  which Eurasia Group said had ""lost momentum"" ahead of the  referendum.   ""For now, we continue to believe the referendum will pass (with  60 percent confidence). But this means there's a non-negligible  risk it will not. In this case, the government would collapse,  despite Renzi's recent protestations to the contrary, paving the  way for an ineffectual caretaker government,"" Eurasia Group said.As Eurasia Group said in its note Thursday, ""political mess in  Athens, Lisbon, Madrid and Rome carry implications for Berlin and  Frankfurt."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel – seen widely as  the euro zone's strongest leader -- can ill-afford problems in  the rest of the single currency area given her own increasingly  fragile grip on power.   Her handling of the region's refugee crisis (in sum, allowing  over 1 million migrants into Germany in 2015 alone) has prompted  a drop in her approval ratings, criticism from rivals both within  Germany and the wider EU. Her own party, the Christian Democratic  Union, has been pummeled in local and state elections, leading to  questions over whether Merkel can stand for election again in  2017.Like most of Europe, far-right parties (like the National Front  in France or Pegida in Germany) have been gaining a foothold in  the political scene, worrying the mainstream political  establishment. Austria is no exception, Eurasia Group noted,  stating that a presidential election on October 2 looked certain  to ""hand power to the EU's first far-right head of state -  (Norbert Hofer).""   ""While his powers as president would be limited, Hofer will use  every opportunity to facilitate a victory for his party in 2018  or before, if any crisis (refugees, euro zone) gives him an  excuse to dismiss the government. As Austria's main  representative abroad, Hofer will seek to strengthen ties with  central eastern European governments which are most critical of  Brussels and Berlin. That would represent a particular challenge  for Merkel,"" the group noted.Europe's migrant crisis has exposed challenges in the region not  only in terms of its ability to respond to a humanitarian crisis  but also its political cohesion and ambitions. Overwhelmed by the  influx of desperate migrants,  the EU struck a deal with  Turkey that would see it preventing migrants from reaching the  continent, in return for money, visa liberalization for Turkish  citizens visiting the EU and fast-tracked EU membership.  That deal was struck before Turkish President Recep Tayyip  Erdogan led a crackdown on the opposition following a failed coup  attempt, putting him at odds with EU values on freedom of speech  and the rule of law, leading the EU to delay its part of the deal  (in terms of visa liberalization). Eurasia Group noted that ""in  the aftermath of the failed coup attempt in Turkey, risks to the  EU-Turkey refugee deal have increased"" and although it thought  the deal would stick the analysis firm said this would depend on  Erdogan's reaction to the delayed visa liberalization.The EU's deal with Turkey has not been enough to assuage the  concerns of certain eastern European nations over migration to  the EU.  Hungary and its ruling, right-wing Fidesz  government has been one of the more vociferous opponents of the  EU's migrant policy response and it is holding a referendum on  October 2 on whether it should reject the EU's migrant quota  system (which would see the country have to accept a certain  quota of migrants).  ""Although the urgency of the refugee crisis has subsided, the  government' hard and effective campaign will boost turnout and  likely result in a rejection of the (European) Commission's  scheme … This result will strengthen Fidesz domestically and  cause more friction across Europe, since Hungary will now be  pushed to take an even more vocal stance against the commission's  current plans,"" Eurasia Group's team noted.Terrorism has yet to be mentioned in the long list of risks  facing Europe but France has had more than its fair share of  terrorism-related events in the last year. After the Paris  massacres last spring (on the Charlie Hebdo offices) and last  November to the recent Bastille Day attack in Nice, the country  has been forced to do some soul-searching over its policies  towards migrants, integration and assimilation – and the  government's response to the terrorism threat.  French President Francois Hollande's approval ratings are at a  low ebb (around 18 percent as of the last Ipsos Mori poll for Le  Point magazine in mid-August) and he has yet to say whether he  will run for the presidency in elections in 2017.  The  dwindling of Hollande's authority – and resignation of Economy  Minister Emmanuel Macron - has left the future of economic  reforms in doubt.  Since Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014 and the alleged support for  a pro-Russian uprising in Ukraine, the country has been on a  collision course with its European neighbors with reciprocal  sanctions now in place between the two bodies.  Despite its economic isolation, however, Russia has seen  something of a resurgence on the global stage recently,  particularly as a key part of the Western alliance fighting  Islamic State in Syria – leaving the EU out in the cold,  according to Marc Pierini from think tank Carnegie Europe.  ""The Syrian war has left the EU in a second-tier position among  international actors,"" Pierini said in a note last month. ""The  EU's internal divisions have given the union little influence on  the course of events in Syria. Yet the brunt of the war's  humanitarian, economic, and security consequences falls on EU  countries. The EU's future role in Syria will be a litmus test of  a genuine common foreign and security policy.""Against such a minefield of potential problems in Europe,  suddenly Britain's decision to leave the folds of the EU doesn't  look too bad – not least of all because nothing has actually  been done since the vote. Britain has yet to trigger the  now-legendary ""Article 50"" of the Lisbon Treaty which would set  in motion the formal process of leaving the EU, and could wait  until mid-2017 to do so.  Europe's institutions and leaders have expressed their  exasperation with the U.K. for its delay in starting the exit  process but given the other issues on its plate, Brexit could be  the least of its worries – especially if leaders like  Germany's Merkel, France's Hollande and Italy's Renzi are soon  faces of the past. As Eurasia Group concluded its note: ""While  Brexit is indeed serious, little or no substantive political risk  is likely from this through year-end. But Brexit's noise  seriously masks meaningful political and market risks in  Portugal, Italy, Greece, Austria, Hungary and Turkey."""
2016-09-13,CNBC Exclusive: CNBC’s Steve Liesman Interviews Treasury Secretary Jack Lew from CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference in NYC Today,0.08905712672947962,"WHEN: Today, Tuesday, September 13th  WHERE: CNBC's ""Squawk Box""  Following is the unofficial transcript of a CNBC EXCLUSIVE  interview with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew live from the CNBC  Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference in New York  City on Tuesday, September 13th.

Additional clips are available at CNBC.com.  Mandatory credit: CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha  conference.  TYLER MATHISEN: Thank you, Mark. So this is Delivering Alpha  Number 6. We're going to start using Roman numerals, so it's VI.  We've had the privilege on five of -- this will be the fifth time  -- save one of our Delivering Alphas, each time we've had the  privilege of Treasury Secretary of the United States being with  us, back to Mr. Geithner's term and now, for the third time, the  76th Treasury Secretary of the United States, please welcome to  the stage, Jacob Lew and his interviewer, Steve Liesman, chief  economics correspondent for CNBC. Got to get the title right.  STEVE LIESMAN: Mr. Secretary, thank you for continuing this  tradition of kicking off Delivering Alpha with us.  JACOB LEW: Great to be with you this morning.  STEVE LIESMAN: Am I right that you were just a little late  because you were meeting with the lyricist for the musical that's  going to be made with your tenureship? Is that right?  JACOB LEW: Just like every other New Yorker, I was stuck in  traffic.  STEVE LIESMAN: Will it be rap?  I want to start off with some of the headlines. I mean, it's been  a series of headlines from your brief, so to speak, over the last  several days.  This morning there's a story that an executive who oversaw some  of the places where there was alleged phony accounts created at  Wells Fargo made $125 million. Do you feel this is money that  should be clawed back or there should be systems in place to claw  this money back?  JACOB LEW: The consumer protection agency that took action  against Wells Fargo is an important new addition to our  protections for individuals and for the financial system. It  didn't exist before financial reform. I think they uncovered  practices that they have taken action against. I don't comment on  specific regulatory matters. But what I can tell you is what I've  seen from what they've done is bad behavior they were correct to  take action against. And how that flows through in terms of next  consequences is going to depend on the facts of the case.  What I can tell you is there's a lot of talk in Washington these  days about rolling back Dodd-Frank, about rolling back the law,  changing the law that created the agency that uncovered and took  action against this. This ought to be a moment when people stop  and remember how dangerous the system is when you don't have the  proper protections in place.  This is something that our watchdogs found. If they were not  there, they would still be going on. This is a wake-up call. It  should remind all of us, and firms, that culture and compensation  make a difference. How you reward people, how you motivate  people, and what values you hold people to matter.  There's a public responsibility, and I think the CFCB took action  reflecting the public responsibility, and there's a private  responsibility. And we each have to do our part.  STEVE LIESMAN: But if culture and compensation make a difference,  then why wouldn't you support a clawback of this?  JACOB LEW: I'm not commenting one way or the other on the  clawback. I really am not going to comment on the facts of the  specific case. It's being reviewed by an independent regulator.  It wouldn't be appropriate for me to speculate on something that  I don't know all the facts of. I think I'm addressing the issue  in a pretty conclusive way. This is unacceptable behavior. And  it's the kind of behavior that we need to be able to catch and  stop.  STEVE LIESMAN: We've had billions of dollars of fines levied on  financial institutions. And still this behavior is still being  uncovered. Is Justice going far enough here? Do we need to be in  a situation where, for example, companies are not allowed to  plead that they didn't commit the alleged act and that there are  individual indictments brought? We haven't seen that in any of  these financial crimes, or very few of them.  JACOB LEW: We have, I think, taken action on a pretty dramatic  basis to put fines, penalties in place for firms that have acted  badly. The question of whether or not to pursue criminal  prosecution is a decision that prosecutors ultimately make. We  have made clear we don't believe that anyone is too big to jail.  It's up to prosecutors to decide how you pursue the criminal  charges. It's not up to regulators or the policymakers.  What I can say is that the pattern of behavior that we've seen  here is something that needs to stop. It is not acceptable to do  things that are designed to increase either an individual or a  firm bottom line by deceiving consumers and passing along charges  that are either invisible or they don't know about.  And this is not the same as a financial crisis issue. This is  really a consumer protection issue. I don't think this is a  moment where we have to ask the kinds of questions that we did in  2008 about what it means about the underpinnings of the financial  system. But when I hear people say we want to roll back the  statute that created the consumer protection bureau, this is yet  another proof point that it was the right thing to create, it's  the right thing to have an independent director, and it's the  right thing to make sure that there's somebody, and an entity  watching over our system, to make sure that individuals get clear  information about their financial products and, when firms or  individuals behave badly, that somebody finds out about it and  takes action.  STEVE LIESMAN: Moving to another company story which is in the  headlines, and you're doing specifically with this issue of  Apple, an attempt by the European Union to get 14 1/2 billion  dollars of back taxes.  Beyond the company-specific story, is this an attempt by the E.U.  to essentially grab unpaid American taxes?  JACOB LEW: You know, Steve, I have an op-ed this morning in the  ""Wall Street Journal"" where I went into some length describing  our views on this. But let me briefly reprieve what I've said on  this. We have for some time told the European Commission that we  believe that this is an inappropriate approach. Why is it  inappropriate? We agree with them that it's wrong for companies  to avoid paying their fair share of taxes to get to zero or very  low tax rates by taking advantage of tax havens.  But the action that the European Commission took is out of the  framework of normal tax policy, a retroactive tax that reaches  into another country, another jurisdiction's tax base, in order  to make sure that a firm pays its taxes. We agree with them that  firms should pay their taxes. But when it's U.S. income, we think  that that tax should be paid in the United States.  We've done a lot of work over the last two years to work on an  international basis to make sure that -- to share information  better. And we have an ability to close several loopholes that  have contributed to the erosion of tax bases around the world. We  need to take action in the United States to decisively change and  pushing firms to take their income overseas. We have a broken  corporate tax code.  We have the highest statutory tax rate in the developed world.  It's riddled with deductions and loopholes that give advantages  that we don't really need or would design for for today's  economy. And the result is we see U.S. companies trying to impart  income in lower tax jurisdictions.  Now, those lower tax jurisdictions are for doing some things that  aren't right also. The race to the bottom with low tax rates to  be a magnet for those companies, that has to change too.  But what action do we need to take in the United States? We need  to fix our tax system. We need to close the loopholes. We need to  lower the statutory tax rate. And one of the things that we've  proposed, which I believe is an idea that will still have  resonance in the year to come is that the revenue that we get by  putting a one-time tax on income that's parked overseas will  produce one-time revenue that ought to be used to fund an  investment in infrastructure in this country.  So we can do two things at the same time. We can fix a broken tax  code. We can make it so that our companies don't feel they have  to leave the United States to put their income overseas. And we  can fix our broken infrastructure.  What I don't think is right is for tax authorities and other  jurisdictions to reach into our tax base and to remove the  ability for us to execute what I just described.  STEVE LIESMAN: So if they're reaching in on Apple, are there  other company cases yet to come?  JACOB LEW: There are a number of pending matters --  STEVE LIESMAN: Pending, but what about ones that you think  there's going to be more of a grab at this point?  JACOB LEW: I can't speak to the European Commission, but we have  spoken on the policy. We don't address individual cases. As I  mentioned before, I'm not addressing the individual case that  they choose to act on.  STEVE LIESMAN: So does that mean you won't join as a party to the  case in Europe, to join as an amicus, so to speak?  JACOB LEW: Well, the European procedure is a little bit different  than ours. They are very aware of our views. We've submitted our  views in a pretty formal way. The parties here are the government  involved and the company involved. They've both indicated their  intention to appeal. And we've made our views known to the  authorities in Europe. And we've done it in a way that our views  will be before the commission on future matters as well.  STEVE LIESMAN: Let's talk about the tax rate, the right corporate  tax rate. 35% is the current top rate, just the federal part.  There's another six points or so according to the OECD that would  be added on some level. You proposed 28. It seems like the House  Republicans wanted 25, and Donald Trump wants 15.  15 would be toward the lower end of the OECD. 12 1/2 is Ireland.  Germany is around 15. Why wouldn't we want a rate that low that  would make America very competitive?  JACOB LEW: The principle that's driven our work on tax reform is  that it has to be revenue neutral. We are -- I don't think -- it  would not be right for us to have individuals pay more taxes for  us to lower the corporate tax rate.  What we've proposed doing is eliminating loopholes and deductions  and using the revenues that we get by doing that to reduce the  tax rate on the business side as much as we can. We got to 28%  essentially because that was the amount of loopholes that we  could close.  STEVE LIESMAN: I get what you're saying, and that makes perfect  sense on one side of the ledger. But the other side of the  ledger, at 28, you're still not competitive and there's still a  13-point incentive for companies to go overseas.  JACOB LEW: In the 25-28% range, we're getting pretty close to the  average. And a few minutes ago, I talked about the race to the  bottom. Some of the pressures on countries that cut their tax  rates to low rates in order to be a magnet, if we, as we have  discussed in the G20 and the OECD and other international bodies,  truly believe that we need to close down the pathways to tax  avoidance, we're going to need to conform to some norms. And  having countries go to very low tax rates is part of the problem.  We have our problem. We have a very high rate and a broken  system. We need to fix our system and take a look at theirs as  well.  STEVE LIESMAN: Is this a failure of the administration for  corporate tax reform here?  JACOB LEW: I actually think that if you look at the history of  tax reform, it often takes many years for it to kind of take  hold. And it's not unusual for it to begin in one administration  and finish in another. I feel we've made actually a great deal of  progress working through bipartisan conversations to build a  growing consensus around the kind of approach that I've  described.  I think that there's an environment now where the political  environment is not one where it has been ripe to take up  something like this. But the ideas that we've been promoting will  be the foundation for action in the future.  So I actually feel we've moved significantly toward tax reform.  You know, it takes a desire on the part of Congress to do  something hard. Hard things don't happen unless there's a real,  real desire to do it. And you need a partner. We have had  individual partners, but, as a whole, we have not had that  commitment.  STEVE LIESMAN: But if you look at this issue from outside the  Beltway, one guy is at 28, the other guy is at 25. Let's get in  the room, spend 7 minutes, and we'll make a deal. It seems like  you were impossibly close almost the entire time and didn't make  it down there.  JACOB LEW: You and I have discussed this a number of times,  Steve.  STEVE LIESMAN: And I still don't have a good -- not from you, but  in general.  JACOB LEW: I do believe that the people that we've engaged with,  who have been leaders on the Republican side, now Speaker Paul  Ryan, some senators who have been engaged in it, we've had a lot  of conversations that lead me to believe there is the basis for  an agreement. I just think the time for that agreement is  probably not the next four months.  STEVE LIESMAN: Do you look back --  JACOB LEW: In terms of need to do it, you look at the  infrastructure component of this, I think there's an urgency  right now to dealing with infrastructure. You look at the action  taken by the European Commission, that's an urgency that we need  to act if we want to protect our tax base.  You have an alignment of forces right now that I think create a  real opportunity. And I certainly think that's an opportunity the  American people would be well served if Congress takes advantage  of.  STEVE LIESMAN: Let's talk about the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Again, that's another program or effort by the administration,  worked hard on it, seemed to get agreement, and now can't get it  through Congress. Do you regret that? Is that a failure of the  administration?  JACOB LEW: Well, first, I wouldn't draw conclusions about what we  can and can't get through.  STEVE LIESMAN: I'm watching my clock here.  JACOB LEW: There's still time for the TPP, Trans-Pacific  Partnership, to be approved.  Let's start with the substance. TPP is a good economic deal for  the United States. It's good for American workers. And it's good  for U.S. security interests in the world. It means that they will  have a more level playing field. American products and services,  which are best in the world, will be able to compete on stronger  ground. And it retains the U.S. leadership in the world on  important strategic issues.  So I think it's vitally important that we get it approved. I  believe there's still support for TPP. There's clearly opponents  of TPP. I can't question that. We've passed through the Congress,  about a year ago, the underlying legislation, Trade Promotion  Authority, which provides the procedural basis to approve TPP.  TPA, I believe, was a harder vote than TPP. It was an  abstraction; it wasn't a specific agreement.  I can point in TPP to how it strengthens labor standards, how it  strengthens environmental standards, how it raises business  practices closer to our own. I can point around the world to  countries that are already taking policy actions, whether it's  Mexico or Vietnam, to meet some of those standards.  I think we have the substance profoundly on our side. What I  think the challenge we have -- and this is a big challenge. We  can make the case that it will improve growth in the United  States, and more GDP should be good for everyone. Where we're  running into a problem right now is the sense that is not just in  the United States, but it's in other parts of the world, that  more growth does not necessarily mean better wages or better  opportunity for working people.  I think the issue that is the real issue that we're going to have  to deal with is to show how the benefit gets to individuals. And  that's bigger than TPP. I think we saw that in the United Kingdom  in the vote recently on the referendum.  STEVE LIESMAN: And that's a failure at every level of leadership,  when it comes to economic issues, the issue of trade and its  benefits. The support of the American people has eroded almost  across the board.  JACOB LEW: Right. But the point I just made, Steve, is it's  broader than trade. I think it gets to the question of a social  compact. I think it gets to the question of how free market  capitalism and liberal democracy thrives. We have to ask some  serious questions about what is it that's holding wages back?  What is it that's preventing individuals from feeling that they  have a share in growth?  I know what we can do at a public policy level. At a public  policy level, talking about infrastructure, and we talk about  skills. If you want to have working people feel that they have a  stake in the future, they have to have the skills to get jobs in  the economy of the future, and they have to have the ability to  get to and from home and work. And they have to see a growing  economy that's going to grow the kinds of jobs that they can take  advantage of. That's bigger than trade.  I think we have a confluence of things that have been going on  between technology and trade and the changing structure of our  economy that are making it a challenging moment. But TPP on its  face should be a clear plus. And we're going to continue to make  that case. And I think we're going to have to demonstrate the  commitment to working families.  STEVE LIESMAN: But, I mean, in that equation, you have to address  the omnibus criticism of the Obama administration, which was one  of regulation that tamped down on private enterprise, and too  much government intrusion into the private sector that really  kept some of the gains getting to individuals.  JACOB LEW: I think if you look at where the economy was when we  took office just under eight years ago, it was in the middle of  the greatest recession since the Great Depression. We were seeing  unemployment at 10%. There was no bottom. We put in place an  economic program that's lifted the United States out of that  recession. We've seen sustained growth. We've seen 15 million new  jobs. We're seeing wage growth. And some of these things that  you're just labeling regulation are also why we're able to be in  a place to meet our commitments to reduce our emissions and to  meet the standards to make this a safer world by having our  climate problems not engulf our future.  There's a lot of things going on inside the package that you call  just more regulation. This economy is a stronger economy because  of the policies we've pursued. It's not as strong an economy as  we would like to see. A lot of what I see as having held back the  U.S. economy is the headwinds internationally. We've seen  probably a half a percentage point of GDP shaved off the U.S.  economy because demand globally has been weak.  That's one of the reasons we put so much time into trying to help  move the global debate towards using more policy tools to grow  demand and grow the economy. And we've made progress there. I  think we've made real progress. You are seeing a number of  countries around the world put in place more aggressive policy  using fiscal tools as well as monetary tools.  So I think there's a lot of things going on. And I think right  now the United States is looked to in the world as being a  resilient economy that's bounced back. What I tell my colleagues  around the world is we can't be the only engine in the world  economy. There need to be multiple engines.  STEVE LIESMAN: I want to get to the overall economy. But one of  the things you've talked about is this need to invest in  infrastructure. The Republican nominee has accomplished something  like half a trillion dollars for spending on infrastructure. Do  you think that's a good number?  JACOB LEW: I have to tell you, Steve, I haven't dissected any of  the campaign proposals. I'm not doing politics in my current  life. I'm happy to talk about our policies, but I haven't  actually taken apart the campaign proposals.  STEVE LIESMAN: Well, what's the right number for infrastructure  investment? I assume you're talking over a 10-year period.  JACOB LEW: Yeah, the right number is a very, very big one. We  have trillions of dollars that need to be invested. It's not all  public money. What we did a year ago, a little over a year ago,  is we extended our surface transportation funding for five years,  basically at level funding, a little bit of an increase. Enough  to maintain what we're doing now, not enough to build the new  facilities that we need to compete in the 21st century.  I think putting several hundred billion dollars of federal money  into a commitment on a multiyear basis to build infrastructure  would have an effect on state and local planning that would bring  more state and local resources to bear and, just as importantly,  would be a foundation for public-private partnerships, which is  what gives you the ability to leverage the amount of resource you  are putting in.  This is not all a question of just federal funding. But federal  funding has been the foundation. One of the things that we do is  we create a kind of certainty out there that there's steady flow  to get projects off the drawing board. Without that, the whole  system slows down. And I think we have taken some time off from  driving that process forward, not to the point that it's  irreparable, but we can't take another decade off.  STEVE LIESMAN: At the same time, when we look at overall economic  growth, we're doing just around 1% the last three quarters. How  much concern has this caused you that we can't even get to the  new lower new normal of 2%?  JACOB LEW: I think when you go quarter to quarter, sometimes you  can overexplain an individual quarter.  We've seen growth in the low 2% for a number of years now. We're  continuing to see strong labor markets. We're continuing to see  improvements in wage growth. Consumers in the U.S. are very  strong. Housing is doing better. Autos have been doing very well.  The weak spot on the economic picture is investment. And I think  that if we could figure out what it is that's going on in  investment and productivity to drive the investment numbers  forward, that would be very important. I mean, I think that there  is a lingering lack of confidence in the global economy coming  out of the economic crisis. It was a deep, deep economic crisis.  It left concern. How do you know we're not snapping back?  I think in the United States we've demonstrated pretty decisively  that we're not slipping back. There are other parts of the world  where every three to six months you wonder, is it going one way  or the other? There's a lot of geopolitical risks. I think we  have to stabilize those risks.  One of the things we do when we meet in the G20 is focus on that.  And just last week we met in China at the G20 leaders meeting.  And I think you heard a few things at that meeting that were  important and different.  One is what I just talked about in terms of inclusive growth, in  terms of everybody sharing in it. We used to be a chorus of maybe  one talking about inclusive growth. All the leaders were talking  about inclusive growth. I think there's a clear understanding  that we have to show that the benefits of growth get to working  people globally right now.  Secondly, there was a commitment to using all policy tools that  is much stronger than its been in the past, where heads of state  are talking about using the fiscal space they have more  vigorously. And I think on the exchange rate issues that have  been so vexing for a long time, we have a clear agreement to  refrain from competitive devaluation and to coordinate together  so that, at moments of volatility, we don't see unilateral  actions that destabilize the global economy.  STEVE LIESMAN: I just want to come back to one of the things you  just talked about, which is using the fiscal side.  Is the fiscal side getting a message from the monetary side that  there's only so far they're willing to go? Mario Draghi last week  suggested, you know, we're at a negative place. We don't want to  go more negative. Possibility of the feds discussing raising  interest rates. Is the fiscal side getting a new message from the  monetary side?  JACOB LEW: As you know, Steve, I don't comment on monetary  policy, particularly not fed policy.  STEVE LIESMAN: We're talking about fiscal policy.  JACOB LEW: I don't think that fiscal authorities needed messages  from anyone that the fiscal tools are important. We've been  delivering that message consistently since 2009. I've been doing  it as treasury secretary for the last three and a half years.  What we've seen over the last three years is a shift in the  debate.  When I became treasury secretary, there was a global debate about  austerity versus growth. We went to G7 and G20 meetings and there  would be debates about austerity versus growth. Those debates are  over. There is no more focus on austerity qua austerity. There is  a focus on making sure there are sustainable fiscal plans, but in  terms of short-term programs, the global community has embraced  the idea that we need to use all policy tools.  Now, if you look around the world, even in the last six months,  you've seen from China to Canada, from South Korea to Japan, more  use of fiscal tools in a responsible way. It doesn't mean build  up debt that's unsustainable. But it does mean don't try to hit  deficit targets and debt targets in the short term when you need  to get your economic engine moving.  I think fiscal authorities during this recession put more  pressure on monetary authorities than they should have. I've said  that all along. Here in the United States, we went too fast in  the terms of some of the fiscal consolidation. There was a big  debate in the United States in 2011 and 2012 about this. We've  done okay. We could have done better. We could have had a little  more growth if we had put some of the savings a few years out and  less of the savings in the front end. Other countries didn't do  as much as we did. They didn't have the recovery. They didn't do  a payroll tax. You know they didn't come back repeatedly and put  more fiscal power to deal with economies that needed it.  It wasn't always pretty in the United States, but we used all of  our policy tools. Our fed was aggressive, our fiscal program was  big, and our reform to the financial system was a structural  reform that we needed here in the United States.  There are still challenges in the future, but our call  internationally is for all the tools to be used.  STEVE LIESMAN: I want to talk about the challenges in the future.  Could you give us an idea -- maybe you've thought about this.  What goes in the letter that you leave for your successor?  JACOB LEW: Well, this may surprise you, Steve, but that's  something you think about when you get to the last day, in my  experience. You don't write it four months in advance.  I think that we're still focused on the work we have to finish in  these next four months. I think that the economy that we are  working through now and that we will leave behind is much, much  stronger in almost every dimension than the economy we inherited.  I'm proud of that. That's something the American people are well  served by.  That doesn't mean that all of the challenges of the future are  addressed. I think these questions of income inequality are deep  economic and social issues. And we've put proposals forward that  we believe deal with that in a sensible way to pay for things  like education, starting with preschool, community college  education, and pay for infrastructure and to have an equitable  distribution of tax burden to pay for it. Those debates aren't  over.  I think that if we take a long break from dealing with all of  those issues, we pay a price. It starts to stress both the  economy and the social fabric.  I think we've done enormously important work. I don't think any  administration finishes the job. You pass the baton, and you give  some advice, and then you try from the sidelines to help move  things in the right direction.  STEVE LIESMAN: So I wonder if, four months in advance, you think  about what you'd do personally. Have you thought about going back  to Wall Street or academia? What have you thought about?  JACOB LEW: I have made one key decision: To live in the same city  as my wife for the next four years.  STEVE LIESMAN: I'm looking forward to Lew the Musical. And thank  you very much for joining us.  JACOB LEW: Thanks, Steve.

It fell to sixth  place from third, allowing Bank of America Merrill Lynch to move up into the top five.  Investment banks suffered their worst first half year performance  since the 2008 financial crisis as revenues for the top 12  players fell 15 percent from the same period a year ago, the data  showed.  Looming U.S. elections, Britain's vote to leave the European  Union in June, near-zero interest rates and worries about China's  economy have spooked markets this year and curbed investors'  appetite to take risks.  Last week, Citigroup said it expects to post better results  in fixed income trading for the third quarter compared with a  year ago.  Most of JPMorgan's revenue, some $6.9 billion, was accrued on its  home turf but the $3.9 billion generated in its Europe, Middle  East and Africa (EMEA) operations was enough to dislodge Deutsche  from the top place in that region.  In the same period last year, Deutsche was number one in EMEA  with revenue of $4.3 billion. Its slide to number two, even on  its home turf highlights how difficult a year it has been for  Germany's biggest lender.  JPMorgan also dislodged Deutsche Bank in the Asia Pacific (APAC  region) to take top spot with revenue of $1.7 billion in the  first half of the year. That was 15 percent lower than the $2  billion Deutsche Bank earned in the same period last year in the  region.  JPMorgan retained its crown in fixed income, currencies and  commodities (FICC) trading, its position solidified by its  dominance in G10 rates and foreign exchange trading. The U.S.  bank slipped a place to third in the equities ranking, however.  Coalition tracks Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP  Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs,  HSBC, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Societe Generale and UBS."
2016-09-25,Former employees file class action against Wells Fargo,0.052777777777777785,"Two former Wells Fargo  employees have filed  a class action in California seeking $2.6 billion or more for  workers who tried to meet aggressive sales quotas without  engaging in fraud and were later demoted, forced to resign or  fired.  The lawsuit on behalf of people who worked for Wells Fargo in  California over the past 10 years, including current employees,  focuses on those who followed the rules and were penalized for  not meeting sales quotas.  ""Wells Fargo fired or demoted employees who failed to meet  unrealistic quotas while at the same time providing promotions to  employees who met these quotas by opening fraudulent accounts,""  the lawsuit filed on Thursday in California Superior Court in Los  Angeles County said.  Wells Fargo has fired some 5,300 employees for opening as many as  2 million accounts in customers' names without their  authorization. On Sept. 8, a federal regulator and Los Angeles  prosecutor announced a $190 million settlement with Wells.  The revelations are a severe hit to Wells Fargo's reputation.  During the financial crisis, the bank trumpeted being a  conservative bank in contrast with its rivals.  A Wells Fargo spokesman on Saturday declined to comment on the  lawsuit.  The lawsuit accuses Wells Fargo of wrongful termination, unlawful  business practices and failure to pay wages, overtime, and  penalties under California law.  Former employees Alexander Polonsky and Brian Zaghi allege Wells  Fargo managers pressed workers to meet quotas of 10 accounts per  day, required progress reports several times daily and  reprimanded workers who fell short.  Polonsky and Zaghi filed applications matching customer requests  and were counseled, demoted and later terminated, the lawsuit  said.  While executives at the top benefited from the activity, the  blame landed on thousands of $12-per-hour employees who tried to  meet the quotas and were often required to work off the clock to  do so, the lawsuit said.  Employees with a conscience who tried to meet quotas without  engaging in fraud were the biggest victims, losing wages,  benefits and suffering anxiety, humiliation and embarrassment,  the lawsuit said.  Wells Fargo was aware many accounts were illegally opened,  unwanted, carried a zero balance, or were simply a result of  unethical business practices, the lawsuit said.  ""Wells Fargo knew that their unreasonable quotas were driving  these unethical behaviors that were used to fraudulently increase  their stock price and benefit the CEO at  the expense of the low level employees,"" the lawsuit said.

2016-09-29,Strides in space farming may boost plan to build human colony on Mars,0.058959859584859574,"Scientists are making strides in growing food in space, and their efforts could  be critical to eventually supporting a permanent human colony  on Mars.""We can grow plants on Mars just by compressing the  atmosphere,"" SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said Tuesday in a  long-awaited speech detailing his vision for sending humans to  Mars by 2025. The billionaire engineer said the Red Planet is  ""resource rich"" with water ice and compounds necessary to support  plants, such as nitrogen.  Experts say astronauts could pack enough packaged or freeze-dried  food to get to Mars and back, although living on the planet for  extended periods would get increasingly difficult without regular  food-supply missions. Mars would require a six-month journey to  the planet, an 18-month stay and a six-month trip back.  NASA has a stated goal for a manned Mars mission  in the 2030s. The agency is studying the effects of long-duration  space exploration on astronauts as well as learning how to best  grow vegetables or other plants aboard a spacecraft or on Mars.  The tests on plants, part of NASA's ""Veggie"" program, have been conducted in a pressurized space garden aboard  the International Space Station as well as in terrestrial laboratories.  At present, red romaine lettuce is the only food grown in space  that NASA has approved for astronaut consumption. The lettuce's antioxidant properties could reduce the consequences  of humans getting radiation exposure in space. Researchers also are  testing cabbage and peppers.""For the astronauts to grow a portion of their food to augment  their diet with fresh, nutritious food, I think would be a  tremendous benefit and savings overall,"" said Trent Smith, Veggie project manager at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. He  said the cost and weight to deliver food to Mars ""is pretty  significant"" and indicated that plants could also grow aboard the  spacecraft on the long journey to Mars.  In recent years, NASA has relied on private companies such as  SpaceX, Orbital Sciences and others to resupply the Space Station  with a cargo load of supplies, including freeze-dried food that has a long shelf life. These cargo  deliveries have taken place roughly around every three months, but  when astronauts go outside of low Earth orbit in long duration  missions on Mars, it will not be practical to resupply missions  every few months.  Musk this week estimated that a one-way trip to Mars for one person would cost  about $10 billion and indicated there were ways to reduce that cost drastically by refilling the spaceship tanks in orbit. He also  talked about the need to build a methane-based propellant production plant on  Mars for the spaceships.  The methane could be created through the extraction of ice water  on Mars and combining it with the planet's abundant carbon dioxide.  Having the local propellant source and fresh food production could go a long way to creating a self-sustaining colony on the Red Planet located 33.9 million miles from Earth.  Moreover, chemical plants could use some of the compounds found  on Mars to create plastics that might be used to build shelters,  greenhouses, vehicles and high-tech potting systems for growing  food.  ""On Mars it will be easier to grow plants, and we can use a lot of  advanced hydroponics and aeroponics systems that we currently  have on Earth and grow plants in lava tubes or any other place  where we can keep an atmosphere,"" said Robert Ferl, a professor  of Horticultural Sciences at the University of Florida in  Gainesville. Both hydroponic and aeroponic gardening can be done  without any soil.  The surface gravity on Mars is about one-third of that on Earth, but that is not a major concern when it comes to growing plants.  The same cannot be said for growing plants aboard the Space  Station in microgravity, where it's a challenge getting the  air and water mixture just right for the plant's roots.Plants under zero gravity conditions  can suffer from either flood or droughts since there's no natural  convection and the water can stick around the roots or edges of  the pot.One way around the microgravity is to use a pillow-like  technology developed by NASA. Seed and soil-like  particles are put into the pillow chamber where they can be more efficiently controlled in zero gravity conditions to support plant growth.  ""Turns out that managing water and managing fluids, especially  around the roots of plants, is fairly tricky stuff in the absence  of gravity,"" said Ferl, who has conducted NASA-funded experiments  on plants.  Space agriculture, whether aboard the space station or in an  extraterrestrial habitat, can provide food and recycling benefits  for crews. The plants recycle the astronaut's exhaled carbon  dioxide and also can use the excreted water. LED lights are used  for sunlight to increase the photosynthetic activity by the  plants.  The public's awareness of the possibilities of space farming may  be limited to what they saw in the 2015 Hollywood blockbuster  movie ""The Martian,"" starring Matt Damon. His character is a  botanist who gets stranded on the planet and grows food to  survive using Martian soil mixed with a fertilizer made of human  manure.  Experts say there's some truth in the movie but suggest using  untreated human excrement as a fertilizer on Mars would be  dangerous. They also suggest that the Martian soil contains toxic  elements that also would need to be removed.  ""Matt Damon would have had to clean the soil a little bit and  remove all these toxic things before using it to grow plants,""  said Lucie Poulet, who has conducted research simulating Martian  soil. She recently published a space agriculture research paper  in Botany Letters with colleagues from France's  University Blaise Pascal.Astronaut Mark Watney, Damon's character in the movie, harvested  Martian potatoes. Turns out potatoes and sweet potatoes are on  the list of vegetables that could be grown in space, according to  NASA. Tomatoes, wheat and soybeans also have been mentioned by  plant researchers as a crop that offers the potential for space  gardens in the future.  Tomato seeds were tested aboard space shuttle missions but didn't  produce fruit as it would have required pollination. Some have  raised the possibility of sending bees or other insects into  space to pollinate plants in space gardens, although there are  other solutions.  ""The astronauts are going to have to become the bees for the  testing,"" said NASA's plant expert Smith. ""My hope is we'll be  able to do some of this robotically. There's no reason why you  can't have a robotic system with sensors to cross-pollinate the  plants.""   For deep space travelers, growing plants isn't just a source of  food but could have less obvious benefits, too. Caring for plants  could offer a psychological boost as astronauts go to Mars and  see the Earth getting smaller and smaller.

U.K. members of parliament (MPs) have called for the creation of  an artificial intelligence (AI) commission to examine the effect  new technologies will have on society.   ""Artificial intelligence has some way to go before we see systems  and robots as portrayed in the creative arts such as Star Wars,""  Tania Mathias, interim chair of the U.K. parliament's science and  technology select committee, said in a statement.   ""But science fiction is slowly becoming science fact, and  robotics and AI look destined to play an increasing role in our  lives over the coming decades.""  Mathias added that it was ""too soon"" to set up sector-wide  regulations for such a nascent field of technology, but ""it is  vital that careful scrutiny of the ethical, legal and societal  ramifications of artificially intelligent systems begins now.""  The world's largest technology companies, including Google and  Facebook, have been investing heavily in artificial intelligence,  which is set to power new technologies from driverless cars to  personal assistants. But it is also being used in the medical  profession to help diagnose illnesses.  British MPs said that such breakthroughs raise ""a host of  questions for society, including ethical issues about the  transparency of AI decision-making as well as privacy and  safety"".  They propose setting up a commission that can examine the social,  ethical and legal implications of developments in AI.   The U.K. has been a hotbed of AI start-ups, some of which have  been acquired by U.S. technology giants. Microsoft acquired  London-based Swiftkey earlier this year for $250 million, while  Google bought DeepMind in 2014. Still, Mathias argues that the  government has not taken any leadership on AI developments.   Experts predict that AI could have a huge impact on the  workforce. AI will take 6 percent of jobs by 2021, according to a  study last month by Forrester Research.   Mathias called on the government to make sure education in  schools and training systems are up-to-date to deal with the  workforce change.  ""It is conceivable that we will see AI technology creating new  jobs over the coming decades while at the same time displacing  others. Since we cannot yet foresee exactly how these changes  will play out, we must respond with a readiness to re-skill and  up-skill,"" Mathias said."
2016-11-11,Grubhub CEO says Trump email 'misconstrued',0.20126984126984124,"Grubhub CEO Matt Maloney says his comments were misconstrued in  an email Wednesday in which he strongly objected to  President-elect Donald Trump's incendiary policies.  ""I did not ask anyone to resign if they voted for Trump,"" he said  in a blog post late Thursday. ""To the contrary, the message of  the email is that we do not tolerate discriminatory activity or  hateful commentary in the workplace, and that we will stand up  for our employees.""  Some workers at the online food-delivery company said they were  left with the impression they weren't welcome if they supported  Trump.  In an email to the company's more than 1,000 employees on  Wednesday, obtained by BuzzFeed News, Maloney said:  ""I absolutely reject the nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful  politics of Donald Trump and will work to shield our community  from this movement as best as I can. As we all try to understand  what this vote means to us, I want to affirm to anyone on our  team that is scared or feels personally exposed, that I (and)  everyone else here at Grubhub will fight for your dignity and  your right to make a better life for yourself and your family  here in the United States.

We do not tolerate hateful attitudes on our team.""  Maloney, a supporter of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary  Clinton, spared no words in his email Wednesday. He said Trump's  words and actions would have earned him an ""immediate  termination"" at the Chicago-based start-up, valued at more than  $3 billion.  ""While demeaning, insulting, and ridiculing minorities,  immigrants, and the physically/mentally disabled worked for Mr.  Trump, I want to be clear that this behavior — and these  views — have no place at Grubhub,"" Maloney said in the email  Wednesday."
2016-11-30,Gold slides as upbeat US economic data lifts dollar,0.167109375,"Gold slipped on Wednesday, adding to its deepest monthly losses  in over three years as strong U.S. economic data buoyed the  dollar and further cemented the case for hiking rates in  December.    U.S. private employers stepped up hiring in November much  more than expected and consumer spending increased last month,  giving more ammunition to the Federal Reserve for a rate  increase.     The data helped the dollar climb half a percent against a  basket of major currencies after last week touching the highest  levels for almost 14 years.                Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the  opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion,  while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.  Spot gold had dropped 1.1 percent to  $1,174.96 an ounce by 3:06 p.m. EDT while U.S. gold  future for December delivery settled at $1,170.80.  Gold has shed nearly 8 percent in November, the biggest monthly fall since June 2013, hurt by a rally in the U.S.  dollar on surging Treasury yields as investors believed  President-elect Donald Trump's policies would invoke faster inflation.              ""Recently there's been a perfect storm against gold with higher risk appetite, rising stock markets and bond yields, massive ETF (exchange traded fund) outflows and the  withdrawal of speculative financial investors,"" said analyst Daniel Briesemann at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.    ""We don't think this is over yet. Normally lower  prices should attract higher demand, but the Indian situation is putting the brakes on gold buying.""    The shock withdrawal of high-value notes to fight  ""black money"" in India, the world's second biggest consumer of  gold, has hit gold demand there during the peak wedding season.  Silver fell 0.7 percent to $16.48 an  ounce while platinum shed 0.8 percent to $910.    Palladium climbed to an intraday high of $772.70 an ounce,  its strongest since June 2015, paring gains to $770.25, up 1.3  percent.  Palladium has risen over 23 percent this  month, its best since February 2008, outperforming other metals.      That rise has been mostly driven by speculators,  overshooting levels that are supported by supply/demand  fundamentals, and so the metal was likely to see a correction of  over $100, Briesemann said.  — Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook."

Bush. ""[Trump] is behaving like an executive. This is like executive  basics. You have a strategy and you put the right skills in a job  to implement your strategy,"" Gutierrez, formerly CEO of Kellogg,  said on ""Squawk Box.""For example, he pointed to Trump's decision to chose Tom Price to  head the Health and Human Services Department due to the  Georgia congressman's intimate knowledge of Obamacare and how to  dismantle it.While Price was also a doctor, ""conventional wisdom"" might have  pointed to retired neurosurgeon and former GOP rival  Ben Carson for HHS, Gutierrez said. But Carson was selected for  secretary of Housing and Urban Development.Gutierrez also spoke highly of Exxon Mobil Chairman and CEO Rex  Tillerson, who's said to be Trump's choice for secretary of  State. He called ""unfair"" aspersions about the oilman being a  friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin just because he's  negotiated business contracts with Moscow.""A lot of what's happening, whether it's happening in an orderly  fashion or now, are things he ran on,"" argued Gutierrez, who said  he did not support Trump during the campaign but aims to be  objective.""During the campaign, he said he's going to go after companies  that outsource and export back in. That's what he's doing,""  Gutierrez said, referring to the deal Trump helped craft earlier  this month with United Technologies to keep the firm's Carrier  unit from closing a plant in Indianapolis.  Trump has also called out other American companies that have big  government contracts. In a Monday morning tweet, Trump took a  swipe at Lockheed Martin's F-35 program, saying the cost was ""out  of control."" Last week, Trump tweeted a shot at Boeing,  threatening to cancel its 747 Air Force One program."
2016-12-12,Billions flood into ETFs—and that could be an ‘A plus’ for stocks,0.04583333333333334,"More than $40 billion has flowed into equity exchange-traded  funds since the election, according to recent Thomson Reuters  Lipper data. And that could signal upside for the market,  according to strategists who don't yet see a market ""top"" in  sight.     ""The overall health [of the market] is an A plus,"" Chad  Morganlander, portfolio manager at Stifel Nicolaus, said Friday  on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""  Morganlander, bullish on equities at these levels, cited analysts  lifting growth and earnings forecasts for next year and beyond.  He and his firm have upgraded long-term returns to anywhere from  6 to 7 percent, up from about 5 percent, and have upgraded their  2017 GDP outlook to 3 percent from 2.75 percent as well.  Since the election, the major indexes have surged; the , Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq Composite have  gained over 5 percent, nearly 8 percent, and 4 percent in that  time, respectively. Analysts see several forces at work pushing  the markets to record highs in recent weeks.   ""This rally is tied to Trump's business-friendly campaign  promises of lower corporate taxes, less regulation and a bump in  infrastructure spending,"" Pat Keon of Thomson Reuters Lipper  wrote in a recent report on U.S. fund flow data.  What's more is that, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data,  last week marked the fourth straight week of net inflows for  equity ETFs.   Indeed, the prospect of infrastructure spending has Phillip  Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures, bullish on  equities at these levels.   ""When you see infrastructure spending being promoted … you  also see tax cuts on businesses. … You're going to see that  expansion across the board here, and that flow of funds is going  to happen,"" Streible said Friday on ""Trading  Nation.""   Alas, these gains have come at the expense of the global bond  market, which in November saw record outflows.  ""So it was a reallocation of funds, and I wouldn't be surprised  if we see a continuation back to the upside,"" Streible  said."
2016-12-14,Economists get more bearish on Singapore’s outlook,0.008796296296296286,"The outlook for Singapore's economic growth was trimmed yet  again, according to an official survey of forecasters released  Wednesday.  The December survey of professional forecasters, sent out in late  November, by the city-state's central bank, the Monetary  Authority of Singapore (MAS), found economists turned more  bearish since the previous survey.   They expected Singapore's economy would grow just 1.5 percent in  2017 on average, down from the September survey's forecast for  1.8 percent and the June survey's projection of 2.1  percent.   The latest forecasts for 2017 growth ranged from 0.7 percent to  2.3 percent.   The December survey, which had 22 respondents, doesn't reflect  the MAS' own forecasts.  In a statement released December 2, the MAS said it expected  Singapore's gross domestic product (GDP) would rise by 1-3  percent in 2017 after rising an estimated 1.0-1.5 percent in  2016.   Singapore's small, open economy has been buffeted by declines in  global trade as well as its exposure to sharp drops in commodity  prices. Redundancies in the first nine months of the year hit  their highest since the first nine months of 2009, during the  global financial crisis, government data earlier this week  showed.  The forecasters expected the headline consumer price index (CPI)  would rise 1.0 percent next year. The survey found the Singapore dollar was expected to weaken further against the greenback, with the average forecast expecting the U.S. dollar to be fetching around 1.465 Singapore dollars at the end of 2017. The forecasts ranged from 1.37 to 1.55 Singapore dollars. At 12:06 p.m. HK/SIN, the greenback was fetching S$1.4255.   In the survey, the forecasters also cut their outlook for this  year's growth to 1.4 percent from 1.8 percent in the September  survey. That followed third-quarter growth coming in weaker than  expected at 1.1 percent on-year, below the September survey's  forecast of 1.7 percent.   The forecasts for 2016 growth ranged from 1.1 percent to 1.6  percent.   The economists now expected the finance and insurance sector  would grow just 0.5 percent in 2016, down from 2.0 percent in the  previous survey. They also cut the wholesale and retail trade  growth forecast to 0.1 percent for 2016, down from the September  survey's 2.1 percent growth forecast.   The private consumption growth forecast was cut to 1.4 percent  for this year, down from 3.0 percent in the September  survey.   The headline consumer price index was expected to fall 0.5  percent for the full year, with the forecast unchanged from  September.  For the fourth quarter of 2016, economists expected just 0.6  percent on-year growth on average, with a median forecast of 0.8  percent. The forecasts ranged from a 0.6 percent contraction to  1.4 percent growth.   —By CNBC.Com's Leslie Shaffer; Follow her on  Twitter @LeslieShaffer1  Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook."
2017-01-20,"As Trump readies for inauguration, environmental, climate organizations express concern",0.09585858585858587,"Later on today, Donald Trump will become the 45th President of  the United States.   With his inauguration now just hours away, CNBC's Sustainable  Energy is taking a look at how environmental and climate  organizations are assessing his potential impact on the  planet.  Trump's previous statements on the environment and climate change  – many of them via Twitter – have not sat well with  many.   To give just one example, in 2012 he famously described the  concept of global warming as having been ""created by and for the  Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""     Trump has also threatened to pull the U.S. out of the historic  Paris Agreement, reached at the COP21 summit in Paris back in  2015, although he told the New York Times in November that he was  ""going to take a look at it.""   For Ottmar Edenhofer, chief economist at the Potsdam Institute  for Climate Impact Research, there could well be issues  ahead.   ""Trump will have substantial potential to cause trouble on  climate policy,"" Edenhofer said in a statement released on  Thursday, before going on to state that Trump could attempt to  ""drive the export of coal.""   ""The economic policy of the new president could also lead to  rising interest rates, which would compromise the competitiveness  of renewable energies,"" he added.   The profitability of climate-friendly technologies was primarily  determined by investment costs, which are dependent on the interest  rate, Edenhofer added. The actions Trump takes in office with regards to the environment  will impact people living both in the United States and the rest  of the world.   On Friday, the chief executive of Friends of the Earth in  England, Wales and Northern Ireland, was forthright in his  opinion.   ""The battle to prevent the world spinning towards catastrophic  climate change is going to be a tough challenge – and, with  a cheer-leader for the fossil fuel industry sitting in the  Whitehouse, it's going to be tougher still,"" Craig Bennett said  in a statement.   ""Donald Trump won't 'make America great again' if he ditches  action on climate change and boosts his nation's addiction to  dirty gas, coal and oil,"" Bennett added."

The bill, entitled ""The State Refugee Security Act,"" was  initially introduced last year, The  Hill Reported on Tuesday. It would require federal authorities to notify a  state 21 days before settling a refugee there, during which the  governor can request ""adequate assurance"" that the  refugee is not a security threat. If the federal authorities can not provide this, the refugee will not be able to settle in the state.  ""The first obligation of the president is to keep this country  safe as commander in chief,"" Cruz said in a statement to The  Hill. ""I am encouraged that, unlike the previous  administration, one of President Trump's top priorities is to  defeat radical Islamic terrorism.""The act echoes the sentiment of President Donald Trump's plan to bar Muslims from entering the United States.

2017-02-03,"Fed's Evans sees fiscal boost to US growth, wants slow rate hikes",0.11412554112554112,"The U.S. Federal Reserve should raise interest rates slowly even as fiscal policies under President Donald Trump are likely to help push economic growth beyond sustainable levels, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said on Friday.""Appropriate policy calls for a slow pace of normalization in order to give the real economy an adequate growth buffer to withstand downside shocks,"" Evans said in remarks prepared for delivery at Prairie State College in Olympia Fields, south of Chicago. ""I favor taking a gradual path for the adjustment of the funds rate back toward its long-run level.""The Fed in December raised rates for only the second time since the financial crisis, and this week held them steady to give labor markets and inflation a chance to strengthen further.Most Fed officials see three rate hikes this year, a pace considerably faster than in 2016 and 2015 but much slower than in past rate-hike cycles. Evans, who votes this year on Fed policy, did not specify a preferred number of rate hikes for this year in his prepared remarks, though a few weeks ago said three is not ""implausible.""Evans said he expects the economy to grow at a 2 percent to 2.5 percent annual pace for the next couple of years, faster than its long-run sustainable pace of about 1.75 percent. Evans said he raised his estimate for growth because of expected tax cuts and other stimulus under Trump and the new Congress.Unemployment will fall to 4.25 percent over the next couple years, he predicted, well below its long-run sustainable rate of 4.7 percent. And that will help push inflation, now at about 1.7 percent, back up towards the Fed's 2 percent goal by 2019.Some analysts have speculated that the expansionary fiscal policies Trump has promised would light such a fire under an economy essentially already at full employment that the Fed would have no choice but to hike rates faster to brake growth.Evans on Friday did not seem too concerned about such a prospect. He warned, as he has before, that if the economy is pushed to grow at 4 percent for more than a couple years without structural reforms that boost productivity and labor force growth, inflationary pressures would build and would ultimately force the Fed to tighten financial conditions.But he also said his estimates are for a much more moderate fiscal boost, though he added it is early in the legislative process and ""there certainly is a possibility of larger temporary stimulus, as well as some policies that might influence longer-run growth.""A government report early Friday showing U.S. employers added more jobs than expected last month was ""very good"" news, Evans said.The unemployment rate moved up to 4.8 percent from 4.7 percent, but that was likely because of more people entering the workforce, a good sign for labor market health, Evans said at an event to benefit Prairie State College in Olympia Fields, south of Chicago."
2017-02-09,US court upholds Obama-era retirement advice rule,0.15265957446808512,"A U.S. federal judge on Wednesday upheld an Obama-era rule designed to avoid conflicts of interests when brokers give retirement advice, in a possible setback for President Donald Trump's efforts to scale back government regulation.The stinging 81-page ruling comes just days after Trump ordered the Labor Department to review the ""fiduciary"" rule — a move widely interpreted as an effort to delay or kill the regulation.The decision by Chief Judge Barbara Lynn for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas is a stunning defeat for the business and financial services industry groups that had sought to overturn it.And while it is not expected to stop the Labor Department from delaying the rule's April 10 compliance deadline while it conducts the review, some legal experts say it could make it more difficult for the Labor Department to find a way to justify scrapping or significantly altering the rule.This marks the second time now a federal district court has upheld the fiduciary rule. A third court, meanwhile, rejected an effort to stay the rule's implementation.""Three courts have now carefully considered the full range of industry attacks on the DOL's best interest fiduciary rule, and they have firmly rejected all of them,"" said Stephen Hall, the legal director of Better Markets, a non-profit group that supports the rule.""The decision issued today is definitive and sends a message that ought to put a stake through the heart of industry's efforts to destroy this common-sense rule.""The Labor Department's ""fiduciary"" rule requires brokers to put their clients' best interests first when advising them about individual retirement accounts or 401(k) retirement plans.It is championed by consumer advocates and retirement non-profit groups, but has been staunchly opposed by the financial services sector, which argues it will make retirement advice too costly and harm lower-income retirees in particular.The long list of groups that sued the Labor Department in the Dallas federal court include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Financial Services Institute, the Financial Services Roundtable, the Insured Retirement Institute and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.In a joint statement, those groups said they disagreed with the judge's ruling and vowed to ""pursue all of our available options to see that this rule is rescinded.""The decision in the Labor Department's favor came just a few hours after the Justice Department had petitioned the court to stay issuing a ruling because of the Feb. 3 White House request to review the rule to determine if it should be revised or scrapped.Lynn, who was appointed to the bench by former President Bill Clinton, denied that request shortly after her ruling was filed.""The Department of Labor is continuing to follow the president's memorandum and is exploring options to delay the applicability date,"" Labor Department spokeswoman Jillian Rogers said in a statement.Sweeping legal arguments rejectedWednesday's ruling represents a setback for Gibson Dunn & Crutcher attorney Eugene Scalia, who represented the business groups and has a strong track record for winning legal challenges to kill off unwanted Wall Street regulations.The decision addressed a sweeping series of legal arguments that Gibson Dunn's attorneys made against the rule, including claims that the Labor Department had exceeded its legal authority and that it had violated federal rulemaking procedures by failing to conduct an adequate cost-benefit analysis to help justify the regulation.""The court finds the DOL adequately weighed the monetary and non-monetary costs on the industry of complying with the rules, against the benefits to consumers,"" Lynn wrote.""In doing so, the DOL conducted a reasonable cost-benefit analysis.""Lynn also rejected other arguments, including claims that the rule violated free speech rights of brokers and that the rule violated federal laws governing arbitration.The case could still be appealed to a higher court.Meanwhile, there are still several other pending legal challenges to the rule."

It covers a 1040 (the standard federal income tax form) and is best suited for simpler tax returns. (Those with multistate filings or a trust or farm subsidies would still be better off with an accountant who can offer advice as well as assistance, according to Credit Karma's founder and CEO, Kenneth Lin.)  Other services include TurboTax's Absolute Zero, which began three years ago for taxpayers filing federal 1040A or 1040EZ returns as well as state returns.The IRS also maintains Free File for more complicated returns (but still not multistate), which is administered through the Free File Alliance, a nonprofit organization of a dozen tax prep service providers, including TurboTax, H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt.Free File projects that, in 2017, it will prepare about 3 million individual income tax returns out of the 153 million the IRS expects to receive. ""One-hundred-million people are eligible, but it's not advertised, so nobody knows about it,"" said Tim Hugo, the alliance's executive director.The program, which walks you through your tax filings step by step, is geared toward low- and moderate-income taxpayers, but each provider has its own restrictions on who qualifies. For example, some will accept all filers who make $64,000 or less while others may have age requirements or geographical restrictions (a wizard will walk you through the available programs that fit your criteria).And you still may not be able to wrap up all your paperwork before April 18 (yes, the deadline is different this year) completely scot-free. There could be some additional charges, including a fee for those who owe taxes and use a credit card to make a payment or for filing a state return online.For those determined not to spend a dime, and still want in-person assistance from a tax pro, the AARP Foundation runs the volunteer-based Tax-Aide program for those who can't afford tax prep help. The IRS also has both a Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program, or VITA, for people with disabilities, limited English or those who generally make $54,000 or less, and Tax Counseling for the Elderly, or TCE, for those age 60 or older.VITA and TCE sites are generally located in community centers, libraries and schools around the country. And many of the TCE sites are operated by AARP's Tax-Aide program.For more information, go to irs.gov."
2017-03-07,Chevron CEO Watson says he supports Trump on tax reform,0.11596736596736597,"Chevron Chief Executive John Watson told CNBC Tuesday that he ""strongly supports U.S. tax reform"" under President Donald Trump's administration. Trump's administration wants to make U.S. tax reform competitive, Watson said during an interview on CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" Specifically he discussed a proposed bill — a border-adjustment tax — that could hike rates on American imports. Despite concerns that a border tax could hurt oil prices, Chevron's Watson said industry imports would ""come into balance"" over time. ""The unpredictable effects of the U.S. dollar strengthening is what concerns a lot of people,"" he explained. A border-adjustment tax would likely result in the appreciation of the dollar, to ease the burden of hiked prices on consumers. Would this hurt a company such as Chevron? Not so fast, Watson said. ""I think what you'll see is a disconnect,"" he explained. U.S. oil prices might rise, but international prices would offset this. And Chevron wouldn't try to move money offshore, either, CEO Watson told CNBC. ""What we'll tend to do is take the cash flow that's generated ... and we'll recycle it into shorter cycle-time investments — the portfolio of assets we have in the U.S., in the Gulf of Mexico, in California and elsewhere."" Since former Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson joined the Trump administration, Watson said he's visited with White House staff on multiple occasions and has been encouraged by those meetings.""We've seen a more pro-business environment ... I think the approach they're taking toward business — toward enabling our economy to grow again — is a real positive."""
2017-03-09,China’s tech giants are pouring billions into US start-ups,0.11217641785823607,"Joe Chen, CEO of Chinese social networking service Renren, first met SoFi CEO Mike Cagney in Palo Alto in 2011 and, over coffee, decided to invest in the fast-growth, disruptive online finance start-up. That initial $4 million investment helped SoFi get its start and led to two more financings within three years, with Renren contributing a major chunk of some $230 million raised.Fast-forward, and SoFi last month topped it off with a $500 million investment from private-equity powerhouse Silver Lake.SoFi is just the kind of deal that Chen has been pursuing: His NYSE-listed company, once known as the Facebook of China, has been investing in  to broaden its revenues and boost its stock price. That connection with Renren has also boosted SoFi.""Joe is a great investor and was our investor from the early days. He saw the vision early on and pushed us to grow faster and be more aggressive,"" said Dan Macklin, a co-founder of SoFi in San Francisco.Similarly to Renren, China's tech titans Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent are leading a surge of Chinese investment in cutting-edge U.S. technology start-ups with bold ambitions to expand their footprint, attract top talent and gain an edge in innovation.Collectively known as the BAT, China's giant technology companies that dominate search, e-commerce and mobile messaging in their home market are going global. The United States is their primary shopping place to diversify and build out their brands. The hunt is on to acquire or buy into fast-growing young companies in a broad range of the hottest tech sectors, such as virtual reality, fintech, social media, video games and mobile apps. Their deals include such well-known American brands as image messaging app Snap, ride-sharing service Lyft and virtual reality player Magic Leap.China's four largest internet companies — the BAT plus e-commerce company JD.com — have invested $5.6 billion in 48 U.S. tech deals over the past two years, according to CBI Insights data. California took in more than three-quarters of the total U.S.-based deals by these four companies, with Silicon Valley a popular hunting ground.Overall, Chinese investment in the U.S. economy has soared, with such high-profile deals as China's Anbang Insurance purchase of the landmark Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York City for $1.95 billion.Last year Chinese investors put a record $45.6 billion in U.S. companies, triple the amount for 2015, according to research group Rhodium Group in New York City. The momentum has picked up as the Chinese economy has slowed and as the U.S. dollar has appreciated against the Chinese yen, points out Rhodium economist Thilo Hanemann.""The Chinese government is spending billions of dollars literally trying to level the playing field a bit"" between the United States and China in technology, said Orville Schell, director of U.S.-China relations for the Asia Society, which released a 2014 report on China high-tech investments in the United States.This flurry of deal making comes against a recent crackdown by Chinese authorities to tighten restrictions on capital outflows and control ""irrational"" outbound investment by Chinese firms. Such restrictions are threatening completion of a $1 billion purchase by Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group of Dick Clark Productions in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, U.S. alarms about potential security and economic risks over Chinese takeovers of American companies have been heightened during the recent presidential election.For the founders of U.S. tech start-ups, getting cozy with Chinese acquirers and investors can make good business sense. With a Chinese investor, their business gains a competitive edge in the exceedingly difficult-to-penetrate China market. Getting funds from China's leading tech companies can help U.S. companies gain an entry point to China, an immediate on-the-ground presence and strategic insights such as how to best customize products for the local Chinese market.More from Global Investing Hot Spots:  The billionaire who is saving Bethlehem with the support of a Saudi Prince   Trump's ban on immigration has an unexpected beneficiary: Canadian start-ups   An anti-Buffett investing bet that's suddenly busting out Moreover, founders of U.S. tech start-ups can get favorable terms from the Chinese corporate investors, which are known to pay more to invest in American start-ups compared with Sand Hill Road venture capitalists. The Chinese buyers are in effect ""paying a tuition"" to get insights into the U.S. market, points out Jay Eum, co-founder and managing director of TransLink Capital in Silicon Valley.China's e-commerce leader, Alibaba, by the visionary Jack Ma, has been particularly active in investing in U.S. start-ups. In recent years Alibaba has led a $793 million financing round in virtual reality start-up Magic Leap, $200 million in social media company Snap, $215 million in mobile messaging app Tango, $250 million in ride-sharing app Lyft, $50 million in remote-control app Peel, $120 million in mobile gaming start-up Kabam in July, $50 million in app search engine Quixey and $206 million in subscription service ShopRunner.Not to be outdone, Baidu has invested $30 million in mobile safety firm TrustGo and $10 million in mapping company Indoor Atlas. Meanwhile, Tencent invested $400 million in game developer Riot Games and another $400 million in Epic Games, in addition to co-investing with Alibaba in Lyft. Besides its groundbreaking investment in SoFi, Renren has invested in a series of U.S. fintech start-ups, leading a $31 million lead investment in crowdfunding real estate site Fundrise in 2014 and leading a $40 million investment in U.S.-based stock-trading outfit Motif in 2015.The China deals typically are for a minority investment stake rather than a controlling interest —in part a strategy to minimize risk while still getting an angle of U.S. tech. Taking a long-term perspective, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent have all established offices in California for research and development and for corporate venture investing. This type of China tech deal making is a long way from the pattern of Japanese deal makers during the 1990s in the United States, when investment from Japan poured into trophy properties such as Pebble Beach and Rockefeller Center and later suffered major losses.The Chinese deal makers in U.S. tech companies are active, not passive, investors. Silicon Valley-based messaging app Tango, which snared a $215 million investment by Alibaba in 2014, holds monthly meetings with a board member at Alibaba to review strategies and strategic impact, says Tango CEO and co-founder Eric Setton. He frequently visits Alibaba headquarters in Hangzhou and has set up a Beijing office. Setton said he got his initial introduction to Alibaba from Jerry Yang, a founder of Yahoo, which has been strongly linked through ownership ties with the Chinese conglomerate for several years.Another Silicon Valley start-up, Peel, has experienced a similar tight interaction with its Chinese investors, which include Alibaba. Co-founder Thiru Arunachalam said he gets access to talent in China through the Alibaba connection and gains leverage in the fast-growing Chinese market.Venture investor Eum of Translink, which has seen three of its portfolio companies (Peel, Tango and Quixey) get invested in by Alibaba, said he has been ""super impressed"" by Alibaba as a strategic investor. He pointed to a synergistic relationship and solid informational interchange as key advantages for both the China and U.S. sides.— By Rebecca Fannin, special to CNBC.com"
2017-03-09,European markets eke out gains at close as ECB holds interest rates; Akzo Nobel up 12.9%,0.10157454171343058,"European markets closed slightly higher on Thursday after the European Central Bank said it was keeping its rates unchanged and vowed to carry on with its asset-purchasing program.The pan-European Stoxx 600 ended 0.08 percent higher with most sectors in positive territory and major bourses mixed. Insurance stocks were among the best performers on earnings news. Aviva ended close to the top of the STOXX 600, up by 6.4 percent, after announcing a strong full-year operating profit.Basic resources, by contrast, slumped more than 3 percent by Thursday's close, on soft consumer price data in China and a weakening of the yuan.The oil and gas sector was also down by 1.5 percent after another drop in oil prices. This came after data from the Energy Information Administration showed inventories rose by 8.2 million barrels last week. Brent crude dropped 2.2 percent to $51.91 a barrel and WTI fell 2.41 percent to $49.07 a barrel. At the top of the European benchmark was Akzo Nobel, the Dutch paints and chemicals maker rejected a $22 billion offer from a U.S. firm on Thursday. Its shares ended 12.9 percent higher on the news. The French publisher Lagardere jumped 10.25 percent after posting a 13.5 percent increase in earning before interest and tax. Domino's sank 13.1 percent with the pizza group announcing an expansion in the Norwegian market and an intention to open 80 new stores in the U.K. It also stated Thursday that its full-year profit rose 17 percent in 2016.Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Dow Jones industrial average and broader S&P 500 continued slightly higher ahead of a probable interest rate hike next week.After solid U.S. jobs figures released Wednesday, expectations of a rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve next week have become even stronger.However, the main focus in Europe was on the European Central Bank. The bank kept rates unchanged on Thursday and promised to keep its massive stimulus program. The bank also revised its inflation forecasts upwards. It sees headline inflation at 1.6 percent at the end of 2018 compared to the 1.5 percent projected last December. In terms of growth, the bank has also revised its forecasts upwards for this year from 1.7 percent to 1.8 percent. However, it called on all euro area countries to step up reforms to ensure stable growth. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi declared the euro ""irrevocable"" at Thursday's press conference ahead of key elections this summer. As a consequence, German 10-year bond yields spiked to hit a one-month high of 0.43 percent and the euro hit session high of $1.0605.In corporate news, the Danish firm Novo Nordisk has begun talks with Global Blood Therapeutics, a U.S. company, for a potential acquisition, Reuters reported. Rio Tinto's chairman Jan du Plessis has said he will step down in the coming year after more than eight years in the job.

2017-03-12,"Britain has a Brexit backup plan if talks fail, says minister",0.010189255189255179,"Britain is drawing up contingency plans for the unlikely event it has to walk away from divorce talks with the European Union without a deal, Brexit minister David Davis said on Sunday.Prime Minister Theresa May is set to begin exit talks by the end of the month, kicking off Britain's most complex set of negotiations since the end of World War Two. The outcome will shape Britain's political and economic future.Ahead of the start of negotiations, which could be triggered as early as Tuesday, a committee of lawmakers warned it would be a serious dereliction of duty if the government failed to plan for the possibility of not reaching an exit deal.""I don't think, firstly, that is remotely likely,"" Davis told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, responding to the report. ""It's in absolutely everybody's interest that we get a good outcome.""Parliament's Foreign Affairs committee warned that a breakdown in negotiations would be a ""very destructive outcome"", causing economic harm to both sides as well as creating uncertainty and legal confusion for individuals and businesses.""The simple truth is we have been planning for the contingency - all the various outcomes, all the possible outcomes of the negotiations,"" Davis said. ""One of the reasons we don't talk about the contingency plan too much is that we don't want people to think 'Oh, this is what we're trying to do.'""Asked when May would trigger talks, Davis declined to name a specific date.""Each date has different implications in terms of when it could be responded to by the (European) council ... I'm not going to get into the details why, but there's politics in terms of achieving success.""Before May can begin negotiations, she must finish passing the legislation that gives her the right to formally notify the EU of Britain's intention to leave and start a two-year negotiating period as set out in the EU's Lisbon treaty.The laws are expected to be finalised in a series of votes early next week, which will test May's authority over her Conservative Party as she seeks to overturn changes made to the draft bill by parliament's upper chamber.The government suffered two heavy defeats in parliament during the legislative process, inserting conditions into the bill saying May must guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in Britain and give lawmakers more powers to reject the final terms she reaches with the EU. Facing a possible rebellion from Conservatives who want to vote on the final Brexit terms, Davis urged lawmakers to back May's Brexit strategy and overturn those changes because they would tie the government's hands in the negotiations.""What we can't have is either house of parliament reversing the decision of the British people - they haven't got a veto,"" Davis said.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook."

For example, over spring break at the Las Vegas MGM Hotel and Casino, the company installed a kiosk selling Snap Spectacles. ""These guys are hardcore marketers,"" Sood said on ""Squawk Alley."" Facebook launched three new Snap-like features Tuesday morning — the fourth time Facebook has cloned Snapchat features in less than a year — sending Snap shares down more than 4 percent.Facebook's big advantage is that it can reach users outside of Snap's relatively narrow demographic and show off features they may never have tried, Sood said Tuesday. ""It gives the an opportunity to play with it and use it,"" he said.However, he added, what works for Snapchat doesn't always work on Facebook's apps.""Instagram tried it with their Stories, and it feels sort of like an after-thought, like a bolt-on feature to Instagram,"" he said. ""I don't get it, to be honest.""Wall Street welcomed Facebook's move to incorporate more Snap-like features. ""It's a great move and one that we expected,"" said Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali.The last time Facebook did something as important as this — when Instagram copied Snap last year — the impact was a slowdown in user growth and engagement at Snap, he said.""It will be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of quarters, but clearly if you're Snap, you're worried,"" he said. ""It's easy to copy a lot of these functions and the issue is really around engagement and user growth, ultimately.""  Disclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Snap"
2017-04-06,Cramer taste-tests the restaurant industry with these two popular chains,0.050034923705136465,"Restaurant stocks are the talk of the Street in light of Panera Bread's takeover by JAB Holdings, so Jim Cramer turned to two food chains to illustrate the winners and losers of the casual dining market.Both Darden Restaurants, the parent of Olive Garden, and Brinker International, the Chili's parent, rallied almost hand-in-hand in the second half of 2016. Once 2017 hit, however, their stocks went separate ways, with Darden rising almost 15 percent and Brinker sliding 14 percent year-to-date.""On the surface, the two companies would seem to have a lot in common,"" the ""Mad Money"" host acknowledged.They are comparable in scale: Brinker has 1,600 restaurants around the globe while Darden has 1,500, and both own smaller brands alongside their trademark restaurants.Watch the full segment here:But once the market started worrying about the wherewithal of restaurants to survive in the stay-at-home economy and Brinker tanked, their stories started to look markedly different.""Brinker is pretty much the baseline here,"" Cramer said. ""Its performance has essentially been in-line with the rest of the industry, which is why Wall Street's quickly turned so negative on the stock.""The Chili's parent suffered a big earnings miss, declining same-store sales, slashed full-year guidance, and bad press on Veterans Day when one veteran was denied a promotional free meal at Chili's.""The company reports again in three weeks. Can't be super optimistic,"" Cramer said.Meanwhile, Darden reported a strong quarter at the end of March that included a bump up in same-store sales, improved 2017 earnings guidance, and a new acquisition of Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. Management was also upbeat about Darden's to-go business, which was up 17 percent.""Here's the thing you need to understand: Darden's turn has literally been years in the making,"" Cramer said.It started with their sale of Red Lobster, followed by major changes in management spurred by activist fund Starboard Value in 2014, and ending with traffic-boosting store remodeling and a growing to-go business.""Compare that to Brinker, where they've got the same old management team and the same old tired stores,"" Cramer said. ""Neither company has particularly healthy food, but Darden's brands are certainly perceived as being healthier than Chili's — the unlimited salad bowl which I love so much, it's better than the baby back ribs for you.""Darden may seem expensive at 19 times earnings, but Cramer gave it a pass because it is one of the few restaurant chains with proof of growth.The bottom line? ""It's very tough to invest in the restaurant industry right now, but that's why it's so important to remember why it's worth paying up for best of breed stocks like Darden, rather than going bargain hunting for companies that seem to be struggling like Brinker,"" Cramer said.Questions for Cramer?

2017-04-12,Gold steadies after hitting 5-month peak as political tensions simmer,0.09255430242272349,"Gold steadied on Wednesday after hitting a five-month peak as political tensions simmered, leaving investor interest in safe havens like the precious metal largely intact.Tarnishing an otherwise brightening outlook for global growth, tensions continued to boil in the Korean peninsula and the Middle East, while worries over the upcoming French presidential election persisted.Spot gold inched down 0.11 percent to $1,272.71 per ounce after hitting its strongest since Nov. 10 at 1,279.80 earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures for June delivery rose $3.90 to settle at $1,278.31 after hitting $1,281.80 earlier in the session, the highest level since Nov. 10.""The short term geopolitical impact will likely fade but( gold) was oversold on expectations of rate hikes and the reality of muted rate hikes sets up the potential for (further) upside,"" said Hamza Khan, head of commodities strategy at ING.Gold tends to gain when rate hike expectations recede because lower rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.The dollar was flat versus a currency basket after falling on Tuesday, though a general risk-off mood that has prompted investors to sell the greenback prevailed. Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday stressed the need for a peaceful solution for the Korean peninsula on a call with U.S President Donald Trump.On Tuesday North Korea warned of a nuclear attack on the United States at any sign of American aggression, as a U.S. Navy strike group steamed towards the western Pacific.Elsewhere, Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday trust had eroded between the United States and Russia, as Moscow delivered an unusually hostile reception to U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a face-off over Syria.In France's presidential race, centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen clung on as frontrunners, but a far-left veteran has surged into the top four, pushing some pollsters to calculate the most extreme run-off scenarios. Gold could resume its rise ahead of the Easter long-weekend, Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, said.""Gold has finally broken and closed above its 200-day moving average at $1,257.50, which now becomes a support. From a technical perspective, the way is now clear for a run at $1,300 and possibly higher,"" Halley said.Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF), rose 0.50 percent to 842.41 tons on Tuesday. The ETF has seen about six tons of inflows this week.Among other precious metals,  dipped 0.22 at $18.26 an ounce. fell 0.48 percent to $962.40 per ounce after rising over 3 percent in the previous session, while  dropped 0.69 percent to $796.50."

The payroll increase nearly tripled the dismal March number.Market experts believe the report likely cements an imminent interest rate hike.""The market has sorely needed a shot of unambiguously positive 'hard' data,"" Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, said in a statement. ""This morning's employment report suggests the Fed will most certainly move in June.""Wages grew seven cents an hour to an annualized pace of 2.5 percent.The unemployment rate dropped even as the labor force participation rate edged lower to 62.9 percent. The employment-to-population ratio increased to 60.2 percent, its best showing of 2017 and the highest level since February 2009.""This just adds to the perception that it's going to be easier and easier to find a job if you want one these days,"" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. ""It's job security that causes people to ask for wage rises. If it's easier for them to get a job outside their company, they're more likely to push for higher wages.""An alternative reading on the unemployment rate that includes those not actively looking for jobs as well as those working part-time for economic reasons dropped to 8.6 percent from 8.9 percent in March, the best reading since November 2007. Those counted as not in the labor force swelled to 94.4 million but that was countered by an increase of 156,000 counted as employed, according to the household survey.Job growth was concentrated in lower-paying areas, with leisure and hospitality adding 55,000 positions. Health care and social assistance rose 37,000, financial activities grew by 19,000 and professional and business services grew by 39,000. Government payrolls increased by 17,000 and mining rose 9,000.The report comes a month after a dismal March that saw payrolls grow by just 79,000, a number that was revised lower from 98,000. That number dashed some of the hopes that the economy was poised for a breakout year in 2017. February's reading grew, however, from 219,000 to 232,000. The weak March payroll gain also closed out a disappointing quarter for U.S. growth overall, with gross domestic product rising just 0.7 percent.Jobs skewed sharply to full-time positions, which grew by 480,000, while the part-time rolls tumbled by 370,000.The Federal Reserve, at its two-day meeting earlier this week, projected that the weakness to start the year was likely ""transitory"" and likely to change as seasonal factors abate. The central bank is widely expected to hike its benchmark interest rate a quarter point at its June meeting.Chances of a hike rose following the jobs release, with traders now putting a 78.5 percent probability on June for a quarter-point raise. December remains the most likely month for another move with a 57.2 percent chance, up a percentage point from Thursday.""The Federal Reserve, while not a religious entity, has indicated that its members have faith that the economy will return to a familiar, steady growth path after a lackluster start to the year,"" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. ""The April jobs report helps them to keep their own brand of faith, meaning that the odds are good that the outlook remains for rising interest rates.""Get the market reaction here.This is breaking news.

2017-05-26,Why one analyst thinks Netflix will rise another 67% in the next few years,0.1861129568106312,"Soaring shares of  are set to stream even higher, according to Rob Sanderson, a research analyst who covers the stock for MKM Partners.Ahead of Thursday's bell, Sanderson raised his 12-month price target on the then-$158 stock to $195. His bullish report appeared to put a bit more wind in Netflix's sails, as the tech giant rose a bit more than 3 percent in the session to close at $163. But if the analyst is right in his long-term call, the stock has even more substantial gains ahead than his current price target implies.To be sure, his target change did not rest on any massive reworking of expectations. Actually, the methodology that leads to his $195 price is almost pleasantly clinical.More from CNBC:Chart points to another 19% rally for Netflix, says top technicianAnalyst predicts a 50 percent crash for Netflix - but admits: 'It is likely that we will be wrong for a while'How one trader plans to make a 300% profit on NetflixSanderson continues to expects the stock to earn $12.12 per share in 2021, and to trade at a forward price target of 22.5 in 2020 — leading to an expectation that the stock will trade at $273 in two and a half years' time. He expects investors to ""discount"" this price by 25 percent for every year in the future it is (as a way to be compensated for the risk of Netflix not achieving those earnings and/or multiple).At the end of January, when Sanderson slapped his prior one-year price target on the stock, one year from then was about two years away from 2020 — so $273 was divided by 1 plus 25 percent, raised to the second power. Now, a year from now is about a year and a half from 2020, so $273 is divided by 1 plus 25 percent, raised to the 1.5st power. Hence the price target moves from $175 to $195.This simple arithmetic can cause one to forget the fact Sanderson is forecasting that Netflix's earnings will explode from about $0.50 in 2016 to more than $12 in five years' time. And to further forecast that even after the stock does so, investors will still be sufficiently optimistic about future profits to slap a high earnings multiple on the company.Sanderson said in an interview Thursday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" that the company has ""more than ample opportunity to continue to scale up [its] content investment on a global basis,"" and that ""the subscriber opportunity is sufficiently large.""While some might be tempted to bet against such heady expectations, Dennis Davitt of Harvest Volatility Management uses the harshest language to warn against doing so.""I've seen a lot of really good investors lose a great amount of money on stocks like Netflix, and that usually comes from when they short them,"" Davitt said Thursday on ""Power Lunch."" ""It's a momentum stock.""However, Davitt says it would be prudent for Netflix investors to buy a downside put on the stock, in order to maintain their upside while protecting themselves from the potential for great downside.""I think Rob's right, personally,"" he said. ""But if Rob's not right, it costs you 5 percent to own the 'insurance policy' on the stock.""Netflix is up more than 30 percent year-to-date."

Both have posted gains for seven consecutive sessions, matching seven-day win streaks for each that ran through Feb. 15. The Nasdaq last had an eight-day win streak in February 2015, while the S&P's most recent eight-day win streak happened in July 2013.Kourtney Gibson, president of Loop Capital Markets, told CNBC's ""On The Money"" this week that ""I think the market is somewhat desensitized a little bit from some of these things. I think the good news is that we are actually focused on economic data and actually focused on the earnings that we are seeing coming out of the market right now""Recent earnings winners included Wal-Mart and Home Depot, signs of life in the dismal retail sector. Last week, HP, Medtronic and Best Buy all posted better-than-expected earnings. On the data front, a fresh reading on gross domestic product showed a better number than the first estimate. Manufacturing PMI for May also saw better-than-expected numbers with new orders at their best level of the year and employment improving.Looking ahead to next month's two-day Federal Reserve meeting, where a rate rise is expected, Gibson says a hike could ultimately be good news for savers. ""For the average American raised interest rates obviously mean higher mortgage rates potentially on the long end of course, auto loan rates will go up. Hopefully we will begin to see some of those savings rates increase for the consumer,"" Gibson said. ""I'd love to see some of the larger bulge-bracket investment banks and commercial banks begin to raise the savings rates for the average consumer as well.""Gibson warns this week's big market headlines shouldn't throw a monkey wrench into your investment strategy. Just stay the course.""Hopefully you are investing for the long term and your financial advisor or whoever is helping you with determining your asset allocation is positioning you for the time horizon which you currently have, in which you'll actually need the money,"" she said.

2017-06-14,Trump sued by Democratic lawmakers over foreign state payments to his businesses,-0.04930059523809524,"More than 190 Democratic lawmakers sued President Donald Trump in federal court on Wednesday, saying he had accepted funds from foreign governments through his businesses without congressional consent in violation of the U.S. Constitution.  The complaint said Trump had not sought congressional approval for any of the payments his hundreds of businesses had received from foreign governments since he took office in January, even though the Constitution requires him to do so.  The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment but has said Trump's business interests do not violate the Constitution. The Trump Organization has said it will donate profits from customers representing foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury but will not require such customers to identify themselves.  At least 30 U.S. senators and 166 representatives are plaintiffs in Wednesday's lawsuit, representing the largest number of legislators ever to sue a U.S. president, according to two lawmakers who are among the plaintiffs.  The Constitution's ""foreign emoluments"" clause bars U.S. officeholders from accepting payments and various other gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval.  ""The president's failure to tell us about these emoluments, to disclose the payments and benefits that he is receiving, mean that we cannot do our job. We cannot consent to what we don't know,"" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, one of the lawmakers bringing the lawsuit, in a conference call on Tuesday.  Representative John Conyers, another plaintiff, added: ""President Trump has conflicts of interest in at least 25 countries, and it appears he's using his presidency to maximize his profits.""  The Justice Department declined to comment.  Similar lawsuits have been filed in recent months by parties including a nonprofit ethics group, a restaurant trade group, and the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia.  They allege that Trump's acceptance of payments from foreign and U.S. governments through his hospitality empire puts other hotel and restaurant owners at an unfair disadvantage and provides governments an incentive to give Trump-owned businesses special treatment.  Rare to sue president  In a motion to dismiss one such lawsuit on Friday, the Justice Department argued that the plaintiffs had not shown any specific harm to their businesses, and that Trump was only banned from receiving foreign government gifts if they arose from his service as president.  On Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said ""partisan politics"" was behind the lawsuit by the Maryland and District of Columbia officials.  Lawmakers rarely sue the president, so there are few federal court decisions the legislators can cite to prove their legal standing to bring Wednesday's case, said Leah Litman, an assistant professor specializing in constitutional law at the University of California, Irvine.  ""But the constitutional provision they're suing to enforce gives them a role in how it's carried out, and that gives them a powerful standing argument,"" Litman said.  The lawmakers in Wednesday's lawsuit will be represented in court by the Constitutional Accountability Center, a public interest law firm in Washington.Each lawmaker is paying a share of the legal fees from personal or campaign accounts.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook."

Of the four so-called FANG stocks, three are reporting this week: Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon. Google parent company Alphabet's quarterly earnings report could be a bellwether for technology stocks, according to one trader. Advertising revenue for Alphabet could indicate if ad dollars are also flowing into smaller, tech companies. Wall Street analysts predict Facebook will earn about 11 percent lower profit this year than they did at the start of the quarter, possibly due to higher capital expenditures. Experts also think Amazon could be the next FANG stock to surge on the back of strong earnings.So in this week's Trader Poll, tell us which is your favorite FANG stock."

2017-08-04,Global investors find a new love as consumer confidence soars in emerging markets,0.11674558080808081,"An increased appetite for emerging markets has grown in recent months, with global investors moving on following excitement over U.S and then European equities.  The MSCI Emerging Market Index has soared almost 24 percent since 2017 began. But with dollar weakness - and consequently a strong euro - set to hurt European companies, investors appear to be slowly shifting elsewhere.""I actually think that it's more likely that investors will shift towards emerging markets … Where valuations are much more attractive,"" James Butterfill, head of research and investment strategy at ETF Securities told CNBC, noting that U.S. stocks are too expensive.Interest for European equities spiked in the first half of the year with the dissipation of the populist threat across Europe, the election of Emmanuel Macron in France, and the economic improvements seen in the euro zone. But recently there's been some patchy earnings reports and a strong euro is likely to further impact profits. As of August 1, 156 companies in the pan-European STOXX 600 had reported earnings for the second quarter. Of these, 49.4 percent reported results exceeding analyst estimates, according to Reuters. In a typical quarter 50 percent beat analyst estimates.U.S. equities have also been on the rise on expectations of big infrastructure investments and tax cuts by the new administrations. However, President Donald Trump has yet to fully concrete any of these proposals and asset managers are still wary of valuations on Wall Street. As such, emerging markets might become the next sweet spot for money managers.""Investors are starting to see fundamentals way more attractive in emerging markets,"" Butterfill noted.""We're not going to see the taper tantrum that we saw 2013,"" he added, saying that emerging markets no longer have current account deficits. These indicate the value of the goods and services a country imports exceeds the value of the goods and services it exports. The ""taper tantrum"" refers to when the U.S. Federal Reserve announced it was winding down its bond-buying program in 2013, which acutely impacted by emerging markets (EM).The U.S. central bank is continuing to tighten its monetary policy - now with rate hikes - but analysts note that EMs are at a stronger position than they were in 2013 and the markets have also priced in the expected Fed moves.""Even with tightening in the U.S., interest rate differentials are still positive for emerging markets,"" Zsolt Papp, EMD client portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC.""Emerging market economies are well placed to absorb the higher U.S. rates. Fed tightening comes in the context of stronger domestic U.S. and EM growth conditions and with EM economies in a substantially better fundamental position versus 2013's taper tantrum episode,"" he explained.Apart from stronger current accounts, analysts have mentioned higher growth and lower inflation as other positive factors in EMs.According to data compiled by Pictet Asset Management, strong investment spending and exports have boosted growth in EM countries in the first quarter of this year. Gross domestic product reached an average 4.3 percent across these countries, in comparison with 4 percent in the previous quarter.""EM growth has reached its fastest pace since the third quarter of 2014. The one concern for investors could be private consumption growth, which was flat over the first quarter,"" Pictet Asset Management said in a research note. However, it added that it sees this metric moving higher given stronger consumer confidence, lower unemployment rates and nominal wage growth.Consumer confidence is at its highest level in these countries since December 1993, Pictet also noted.Papp from JPMorgan added that the situation for EM corporates has also improved as recent earnings showed. However, analysts also warned that protectionist policies and some geopolitical risks need to be monitored when assessing investments in the EM world.""Emerging markets have returned 18 percent year-to-date so investors may be questioning whether there is more mileage and returns in this asset class,"" Emily Whiting, client portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC.Attractive returns, reasonable valuations and softening in U.S. dollar strength ""are three reasons why it is not too late to invest in emerging markets,"" Whiting added.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook."

""Benchmark's false allegations are wholly without merit and have unnecessarily harmed Uber and its shareholders.""More from Recode:   Travis Kalanick's new lawyers say the Uber-Benchmark lawsuit belongs in arbitration   A top venture capital lobbyist says more sexual harassment allegations will emerge from Silicon Valley   Some startup founders are 'nervous' about dealing with Benchmark after it sued Uber The arguments were made in a courtroom in Georgetown, Del., before Judge Samuel Glasscock of Delaware's Court of Chancery.Benchmark sued Kalanick after ousting him as CEO of the world's most valuable privately held company, claiming that he defrauded them. The firm asked the court to remove him from Uber's board, among other actions. Kalanick, Uber's founder, says he is the victim of a malicious slander brought by disgruntled investors.Benchmark was seeking a status quo order that would effectively freeze Kalanick's involvement in Uber business. Kalanick's lawyers tried to move the case to arbitration, allowing him to avoid a possibly damaging deposition.The judge did not immediately rule on the status quo order.There is still risk with such a move.

2017-09-06,Draghi could leave investors in the dark with QE exit delayed,0.06827770183033342,"The European Central Bank (ECB) is likely to hold off on making any announcements on its stimulus program when it meets this week, instead opting to push new developments to October in the face of a strong euro.President Mario Draghi said at the last ECB press conference that the Governing Council would discuss the future of its QE (quantitative easing) program in ""the fall"" - prompting many to speculate that he could detail a reduction of stimulus in September.However, with the fall technically only starting only at the end of September, these market participants may have gotten ahead of themselves.  ""The stronger euro could lead to such a heated debate that the ECB could postpone fall until the Indian summer period in late October,"" said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist for Germany and Austria at ING Diba, in a research note.""Either way, the big question for this week's meeting is whether Draghi will shed some light on the ECB's game plan for tapering,"" he added.The euro has appreciated by around 2.4 percent against the greenback since the last meeting of the bank in July and concerns are growing that the strong euro might dampen the recovery and weaken inflation prospects. The higher the euro, the more expensive products and services get for non-euro customers, which might affect exports from the currency union. At the same time it dampens inflation as imported goods get cheaper.""Putting more effort into explaining why the euro is rising on it and on how the balance sheet will continue to deliver stimulus even after tapering could allow for gradual tapering,"" said ECB watcher Anatoli Annenkov of Societe Generale in a note.""(The) core inflation forecast for 2019 is thus crucial,"" he added.On Thursday the ECB also will publish a new round of forecasts for inflation and growth. Given the higher euro, there could be a downward correction for inflation with possible market-moving effects.""Between the June and September projections, the euro has appreciated by some 4.2 percent, implying that the 2018 headline inflation forecast could be cut by some 0.2 percentage points to around 1.1 percent,"" said Annenkov.  So it will be up to ECB President Mario Draghi to explain why the ECB, despite the inflation outlook, thinks it is right to taper (gradually reduce stimulus).  A poll conducted by Reuters among 66 economists says that the majority expect the ECB to announce a scaling back of its QE program in October and to shut down the program altogether by the end of next year.""Tapering is (almost) unavoidable. In the discussion on the game plan, let us not forget that, due to bond scarcity, some kind of tapering in 2018 is almost unavoidable,"" added Brzeski."

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents. According to the results, only Canadian executives put climate change in their top risks."

2017-10-30,"D.C. drama could have detrimental impact on the market, some strategists say",0.06372171563660925,"As political uncertainty continues to mount, some strategists fear intensifying D.C. drama could further push out a tax reform package and roil markets. Following Monday's disclosure that two former Trump campaign officials were indicted as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, continued political turmoil could have a potential ""long-term and very negative impact on capital markets,"" said strategist Boris Schlossberg. ""The critical question going forward is whether this is just a one-and-done, or whether it's just the beginning of a very long and perhaps a very, very tedious judicial process that could really weigh both on Washington and Wall Street as we go forward,"" Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, said Monday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" These questions come as economic data have been ""superb,"" Schlossberg said. Specifically, he pointed to the latest consumer spending data, which reflected the largest monthly gain since 2009 (likely affected by spending related to recent hurricane devastation), and personal income, which also rose month-over-month. Still, ""markets are very concerned, because the big catalyst going forward is tax reform. That's what the market is looking for as the next jump-start to get the economy going to the next level,"" he said.Should the administration's agenda stall further, ""that could weigh very badly on the market,"" he said. According to a Bloomberg News report on Monday, Republicans are considering ""gradually"" lowering the corporate tax rate, and markets had a relatively muted response. Furthermore, the market is also ripe for some kind of pullback, Schlossberg said, which gives him an overall cautious view heading into the rest of the year. Others are less concerned about the probability that Mueller's investigation into Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election could weigh meaningfully on equities. ""There is some trepidation on the Mueller indictments but we are starting to see Trump as teflon, so much so that we think he can 'get away with' firing Mueller and markets would actually take that well as it would remove an overhang. Cries for impeachment remain far fetched whether we like that emotionally or not,"" Michael Block, chief strategist at Rhino Trading Partners, wrote Monday in a note to clients. Block added: ""And the crazy thing is, if Trump does fire Mueller, it's probably bullish for stocks. It would show that this guy can do anything he wants including shove pro business legislation down everyone's throat.

And while other campaign pledges were yet to come to fruition, the U.S. commerce secretary said it would be unfair to blame President Donald Trump ""when Congress fails to act on something.""Trump is still searching for his first major legislative victory since becoming president. House and Senate Republicans are currently on a fast-track to pass separate tax bills before the Thanksgiving holiday. Republican lawmakers would then look to iron out any differences in December and attempt to send a final version to Trump's desk before the year ends.

""This is benefiting Lowe's, although not quite as much as it is Home Depot — which remains the destination of choice for many casual improvers and professionals.""After initially rising following the earnings report, Lowe's shares fell less than 1 percent Tuesday morning.Looking to the full year, Lowe's still expects revenue to increase roughly 5 percent by the end of fiscal 2017, with sales at its established stores rising 3.5 percent. Lowe's is also on track to have added about 25 home improvement and hardware stores before the year is over.The current fourth quarter brings ""tough comps,"" unknown impacts from weather and heavy holiday promotions in certain categories, CEO Robert Niblock told CNBC. Considering those factors, it made sense for the company to reaffirm its prior financial outlook, he added.Management also said on a call with analysts and investors that it expects some incremental hurricane-related sales in the fourth quarter.""Looking at Lowe's in isolation, this is a good report today,"" Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Brian Nagel told CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""The one ""negative,"" according to Nagel, would be rival Home Depot reporting even better same-store sales growth of 7.9 percent last week.Lowe's also announced that Chief Operating Officer Rick Damron will retire and be replaced by the president of the company's international business, Richard Maltsbarger, effective Feb. 3.In his new role, Maltsbarger will lead Lowe's push into creating more ways to reach customers whether they are buying online or in stores.In an attempt to lure younger shoppers, Lowe's has been experimenting with technology and opened up ""smart home centers"" at some locations ahead of the holidays.Earlier this year, Lowe's rolled out a virtual reality experience that offers do-it-yourself assistance through tutorials inside Lowe's Holoroom. Then, in September, Lowe's launched two new augmented reality apps — one for measuring an object, or distance, within the phone's camera view, and one for viewing images of furnishings, at scale, within a user's own home.""We drove traffic in-store and online with compelling messaging,"" Niblock said in a statement Tuesday. He added the company continues to invest in these efforts.Lowe's also said Tuesday it bought back $500 million in stock during the third quarter.Lowe's shares have climbed a little more than 14 percent in 2017."
2017-12-01,"North Korea's Hwasong-15 missile is new type of ICBM, Seoul says",0.18290781188508462,"The Hwasong-15 missile that North Korea launched on Wednesday is a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile which can fly over 13,000 km (8,080 miles), a South Korean defense ministry spokesman told Reuters on Friday.Earlier this week, Pyongyang said it had test-fired its most advanced missile, putting the U.S. mainland within range, and in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.The latest provocation from the North prompted more insults from U.S. President Donald Trump, who referred to North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un as ""Little Rocket Man"" and a ""sick puppy"".Trump had also dismissed a Chinese diplomatic effort to rein in North Korea's weapons program as a failure on Thursday, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Beijing was doing a lot, but could do more to limit oil supplies to Pyongyang. Despite international condemnation and sanctions, North Korea has continued on its path towards developing a nuclear-tipped missile that could hit the United States.After North Korea released video footage and photographs of Hwasong-15, analysts have said they appeared to show the North was indeed capable of delivering a nuclear weapon anywhere in the United States and could only be two or three tests away from being combat ready.South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Thursday in a phone call with Trump that the new missile was North Korea's most advanced so far, but it still has some technical issues to settle, like re-entry and terminal guidance system technology. Trump and Moon pledged to continue applying strong sanctions and pressure on North Korea to bring it to talks. Addressing an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting after this week's missile launch, the United States warned North Korea's leadership it would be ""utterly destroyed"" if war were to break out."
2017-12-13,Yellen says high stock market value does not mean it's overvalued,0.10023026315789474,"Fed Chair Janet Yellen said current high stock market valuations do not mean the market is overvalued or that a sell-off would pose much risk to the economy or financial system.During her final press briefing on Wednesday, Yellen said when the Fed warns that asset levels are elevated, it means metrics, such as the price-to-earnings ratio for stocks, are on the high end of historical ranges.""But economists are not great knowing what appropriate valuations are,"" she said. ""We don't have a terrific record. And the fact that those valuations are high doesn't mean that they are necessarily overvalued.""Yellen said the low-rate environment is supportive of higher valuations. ""We are enjoying solid economic growth with low inflation. And the risks to the global economy look more balanced than they have in many years,"" she said.The Fed assesses whether there would be an economic impact or financial stability concerns if the stock market were to sell off. ""I think when we look at other indicators of financial stability risks, there is nothing flashing red there or possibly even orange,"" she said.She said the banking system is more resilient than in the past, and there is not a ""worrisome buildup in leverage or credit growth at excessive levels.""""This is something that the FOMC pays attention to,"" she said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee. ""But if you ask me: 'Is this a significant factor shaping monetary policy now?' Well, it's on the list of risks. It's not a major factor."""
2018-01-11,"Trump renews call for internet tax, making a veiled threat against Amazon",0.05568181818181817,"President Donald Trump repeated an earlier call for an internet tax, in a thinly veiled shot at Amazon's Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post. ""The internet — they're going to have to start paying sales tax because it's very unfair what's happening to our retailers all over the country that are put out of business,"" Trump said Wednesday.Trump also reiterated concerns about Amazon's effect on the U.S. Postal Service as it struggles to keep up with online orders. The comments mirror tweets from the president in December that named the e-commerce giant. Dec tweet""There's always been a fear for players like an Amazon or a Google that something like this could actually get through,"" Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, told CNBC. ""We believe it's more noise than a real threat.""There's been speculation that the president's shots at Amazon are aimed at Bezos, whose newspaper has published stories critical of the president.Amazon already collects sales tax on products it sells directly to consumers, but has faced challenges from states over its policy of allowing third-party vendors to charge varying levels of sales tax. In June South Carolina filed a complaint against the online retailer, and Amazon agreed in November to take on additional third-party tax burden in its home state of Washington. The issue has garnered more attention as Amazon continues to take a bigger share of overall retail sales. Amazon celebrated its ""biggest holiday"" shopping season at the end of last year. There is an underlying movement among traditional brick-and-mortar retailers to more heavily tax Amazon, Ives said, so the discussion is ""something you have to keep an eye on."" But the likelihood that an internet tax would pass is small, he said.""Listen they've [Amazon] significantly changed the retail landscape across the world,"" Ives said. ""I think it's more of the same where they're getting in the crosshairs.""

2018-02-13,Shopping for a home? It will take a lot longer than you think because home prices are overheating,0.12263602410661238,"Homes today are selling in about 40 days on average, almost two weeks faster than a year ago. But it is taking a lot longer for shoppers to find a home to buy.Two-thirds of buyers are shopping for more than three months before signing a deal, according to a new survey from the National Association of Home Builders. Why so long? They can't find a home they can afford.Forty-two percent of buyers surveyed said prices were out of reach for the homes they wanted. Home prices have been rising at a fast clip in the past year – faster than income growth and inflation. The primary reason is a lack of homes for sale, especially lower-priced homes.""It's the inventory problem that we're having out there that is causing these long delays in pulling the trigger,"" said Rose Quint, assistant vice president for survey research at the NAHB. ""It's lack of affordability, although the other problems are serious as well.""About a third of those surveyed said they couldn't find a home with features they wanted or in a neighborhood they wanted. Back to prices though, 27 percent said they kept getting outbid on their offers. Bidding wars are now the rule, not the exception, in most major U.S. markets.Home prices rose in 92 percent of the nation's measured housing markets at the end of last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. Twenty-six markets (15 percent) saw double-digit increases in prices. That was more than in the third quarter.""These consistent, multiyear price gains have certainly been great news for homeowners, and especially for those who were at one time in a negative equity situation,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors. ""However, the shortage of new homes being built over the past decade is really burdening local markets and making home buying less affordable.""The lack of supply should benefit the homebuilders, and it may be already. Mortgage applications to purchase a newly built home jumped 18 percent in January compared with a year ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.""This complements other positive news on U.S. job growth suggesting that economic fundamentals are strong,"" said Lynn Fisher, MBA vice president of research and economics, in a release. ""Based on applications, we estimate that new home sales were running at a pace of 700,000 on a seasonally adjusted annual basis – the highest such estimate in our survey which began in 2013.""The jump in demand is sizable, but the number of new homes for sale is still below historical averages and far below the number needed to satisfy both new and pent-up demand. The largest generation, millennials, are now moving into their homebuying years in force, but clearly not finding what they can afford.""The whole industry has been clamoring for builders to increase their production, but they're trying,"" said Quint. ""The prices of lumber and labor and land are increasing so fast, they're constrained at the bottom, at how low a price they can really achieve.""The NAHB is predicting a 5 percent increase in new home construction in 2018 compared with 2017. The market could absorb far more, not just in major metropolitan areas, but across the nation."

Russia has proposed a rival resolution that would simply extend the mandate of the regime for one year and not mention Iran.The United States has been lobbying for months for Iran to be held accountable at the United Nations, while at the same time threatening to quit a 2015 deal among world powers to curb Iran's nuclear program if ""disastrous flaws"" are not fixed.Britain drafted a resolution in consultation with the United States and France that initially wanted to condemn Iran for violating an arms embargo on Houthi leaders and include a council commitment to take action over it.The latest British draft drops the condemnation and instead expresses concern that U.N. experts monitoring the sanctions reported Iran had violated a targeted arms embargo by failing to stop missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles reaching the Houthis.A proxy war is playing out in Yemen between Iran and U.S. ally Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting Iran-allied Houthi rebels. Iran has denied supplying the Houthis weapons.A U.N. Security Council resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, France or Britain to pass.Both resolutions seek to renew a U.N. ban on the supply of weapons to Houthi leaders and ""those acting on their behalf or at their direction."" It can also blacklist individuals and entities for threatening the peace and stability of Yemen or hindering aid access.U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley took her Security Council colleagues to Washington in January to view pieces of missiles fired by the Houthis at Saudi Arabia in a bid to boost the U.S. case against Iran.Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said after the visit that he does not believe there is a case for United Nations action against Iran. Iran has described the arms displayed in Washington as ""fabricated."""

The Nasdaq composite ended 0.8 percent lower at 7,273.01.Jeff Kilburg, CEO of KKM Financial said the S&P 500 dipped below its 50-day moving average late in the session. ""That forces some technical selling pressure and flushes out some weak longs,"" he said.Earlier in the session, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose as much as 0.6 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. The Dow gained as much as 166.12 points. The Dow and S&P 500 snapped 10-month winning streaks, their longest since 1959. The Nasdaq posted a monthly loss for the first time in eight months.

The major averages dipped in correction territory earlier this month, falling 10 percent from record highs set on Jan. 26. The move lower came as fears of rising inflation sent rates higher and sent market volatility surging after a year of unprecedented calm.""The volatility is being caused by one overarching theme: The market doesn't know what to expect from the Fed,"" said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report. ""There's uncertainty around that and it's going to continue for the next several months.""But the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq had recovered some  of those losses as of Wednesday's close.

On Tuesday, the 10-year U.S. note yield jumped about five basis points to over 2.9 percent after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at the possibility of more than three rate hikes for 2018 in his testimony to Congress members.Powell's testimony also sent stocks reeling. The Dow closed nearly 300 points lower, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished the previous session down 1.3 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively.""Valuations keep getting stretched,"" said Eric Ervin, CEO of Reality Shares. ""As long as rates remain low, the market can justify them. But as rates go higher, then we have to have higher earnings growth. The question is can companies sustain this.""Powell is scheduled to testify in front of Congress again on Thursday.In corporate news, home improvement retailer Lowe's reported weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings, sending the company's stock down more than 6 percent. Booking Holdings — formerly known as Priceline — saw its shares spike more than 6 percent after reporting better-than-expected adjusted earnings.Correction: Powell is scheduled to testify in front of Congress on Thursday.

""Both the UK and EU are clear this implementation period must be time limited and cannot become a permanent solution."" ""We are now approaching a crucial moment. There is no escaping the complexity of the task ahead of us. We must not only negotiate our exit from an organisation that touches so many important parts of our national life, we must also build a new and lasting relationship while, given the uncertainty inherent in this negotiation, preparing for every scenario.""""We will need an arbitration mechanism that is completely independent, something which again is common to free trade agreements. This will ensure that any disagreements about the purpose or scope of the agreement can be resolved fairly and promptly.""""We will also want to explore with the EU how the UK could remain part of the EU agencies, such as the chemicals, medicines and aerospace industries. ""We would of course accept that this would mean abiding by the rules of those organisations and making an appropriate financial contribution.""""Yes there will be ups and downs in the months ahead. As in any negotiation no-one will get everything they want, we will not be buffeted by the demands to talk tough or threaten a walkout, just as we will not accept the counsels of despair that this simply cannot be done. ""We will move forward by calm patient discussion of each other's positions.""""We have a shared interest in getting this right so let's get on with it.""""No we won't think again on Brexit. The British people voted for Brexit and I think it is incumbent on their politicians to deliver on the decision that we asked them to take.

""Successive British governments have worked tirelessly together with all the parties in Northern Ireland and with the Irish government to bring about the historic achievement of peace. This is an agreement that we have all worked hard to protect. That is why I have consistently put holding up the Belfast agreement at the heart of our approach. ""Our departure poses particular challenges for Northern Ireland and for Ireland. We joined the EU together 45 years ago and it's not surprising that our decision to leave has caused anxiety and a desire for concrete solutions. ""We have been clear all along that we don't want to go back to a hard border in Northern Ireland. We have ruled out any physical infrastructure at the border and related checks and controls, but it's not good enough to say ""we won't enforce it if the EU forces Ireland to do it, that's down to them"". We chose to leave and we have a responsibility to help find a solution. But we can't do it on our own, it is for all of us to work together. And the Taoiseach and I agreed our teams should now do just that. ""Just as it would be unacceptable to go back to a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, it would also be unacceptable to break up the United Kingdom's own common market by making a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea.""""People voted to take back control of our money, our laws and our borders and that's exactly what we will be doing. Yes there are some areas where, and ultimately parliament will always be sovereign, and it will be parliament that will make these decisions. There are some areas, as I've set out in the goods, er descriptions of goods, where from an economic point of view, businesses say it makes sense for us to operate on very much the same basis so that we can continue that good trading relationship, but the decision on those rules of course will be for parliament."""
2018-03-20,"Facebook is facing a level of uncertainty it hasn’t seen before, Goldman Sachs says",0.030083805083805076,"Facebook's ability to manage its data scandal will ultimately determine its long-term future, according to Goldman Sachs.Facebook was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 on Monday, posting its biggest one-day decline since March 2014. This followed reports over the weekend that political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica was able to collect data on 50 million people's profiles without their consent.The London-based company worked on Facebook ads with the Trump campaign, providing details on American voters.Facebook has come under fire for its role in the scandal and has been accused of mishandling users' data. ""It certainly introduces a level of uncertainty that we haven't seen with Facebook before,"" Heath Terry, lead internet research analyst at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC on Tuesday.Terry said every fast-growing tech giant was likely to face a similar crisis, such as the so-called click fraud scandal that threatened Google's growth prospects in recent years.""That's going to be the same here for Facebook. It's going to be how they manage through this that will ultimately determine their long-term future,"" Terry said.Goldman Sachs has a buy rating on Facebook's stock. Prior to revelations in recent days about the potential misuse of Facebook data, U.S. lawmakers had already grappled with social media platforms' growing political influence and whether it would be necessary to impose more stringent regulatory measures.Terry said that while heightened regulatory measures regarding online political ads were now inevitable, the prospect of significantly onerous regulatory measures would be ""something we have got to watch.""When asked whether such measures could then impact the growth story of Facebook, Terry replied: ""Certainly.""The media firestorm surrounding Facebook and Cambridge Analytica comes after Britain's Channel 4 News carried out an undercover investigation into the London-based political data firm. Undercover filming appeared to show senior executives suggesting the firm could use sex workers, bribes, ex-spies and fake news to help candidates win votes around the world.The Channel 4 News investigation, broadcast Monday, comes after articles published by The New York Times and U.K. newspaper The Observer, showed how the data of millions of Facebook profiles ended up being given to Cambridge Analytica.Academician Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research created an app called ""thisisyourdigitallife"" in 2014. Users were paid to take a psychological test and the app collected the data. It also gathered data on a person's Facebook friends, according to the newspapers.In this way, 50 million Facebook profiles were mined for data. Kogan then shared this with Cambridge Analytica, which allowed the firm to build a software solution to help influence choices in elections, according to whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who revealed the alleged practices to both newspapers.Both Kogan and Cambridge Analytica have denied wrongdoing. In a company statement, Cambridge Analytica said the Channel 4 News investigation had ""grossly misrepresented"" the conversations caught on camera.""In playing along with this line of conversation, and partly to spare our 'client' from embarrassment, we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios,"" it said. ""Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honeytraps',"" the firm added."
2018-03-23,China responds to Trump tariffs with proposed list of 128 US products to target,0.13321987152632314,"The world's second-largest economy has responded to President Donald Trump's controversial trade tariffs.China's commerce ministry proposed a list of 128 U.S. products as potential retaliation targets, according to a statement on its website posted Friday morning.The U.S. goods, which had an import value of $3 billion in 2017, include wine, fresh fruit, dried fruit and nuts, steel pipes, modified ethanol, and ginseng, the ministry said. Those products could see a 15 percent duty, while a 25 percent tariff could be imposed on U.S. pork and recycled aluminium goods, according to the statement.The statement did not go into greater detail. U.S. agricultural products, particularly soybeans, have been flagged as the biggest area of potential retaliation by Chinese President Xi Jinping's administration.Beijing will take measures against the 128 U.S. goods in two stages if it cannot reach an agreement with Washington, the ministry said, adding that it could take legal action under World Trade Organization rules.Asian stock markets took a dive on the news, with Japan's  index sliding as much as 4 percent.The Friday response from Beijing is relatively measured, experts told CNBC.The decision to target $3 billion in U.S. imports is significant, ""but it's not a lot in terms of the total U.S.-China relationship,"" said economist Tony Nash, who is CEO and founder of data analytics firm Complete Intelligence.Chinese imports from the U.S. are expected to hit $172 billion this year, he pointed out.Recent U.S. trade actions severely damage the multilateral trading system and disturb the international trading order, China's commerce ministry said, urging Washington to resolve its issues with Beijing to avoid harming the bilateral relationship.Trump signed an executive memorandum on Thursday that will impose tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports. ""This is the first of many"" trade actions, the president said. The new measures will primarily target certain products in the technology sector where Beijing holds an advantage over Washington.That followed Trump's executive order earlier this month that imposed broad duties on foreign aluminum and steel imports — an action that many said could trigger a global trade war.—Reuters contributed to this report."

2018-04-24,Twitter's former 'Mr. Fixit' takes over analytics start-up Mixpanel as 29-year-old CEO steps down,0.12771604938271605,"Suhail Doshi started software developer Mixpanel in 2009 after dropping his studies at Arizona State University to join the Y Combinator accelerator program. He was 20 years old.Now, after more than nine years running the data analytics company and dealing with the many highs and lows of Silicon Valley entrepreneur life, Doshi is taking a step back.On Tuesday, Doshi is informing Mixpanel's 300 employees at a companywide meeting that he's handing over the CEO role to Amir Movafaghi, the company's head of finance and operations. Doshi will become chairman of the board.""I just need a break,"" Doshi told CNBC. ""It's been a marathon.""With the help of an executive search firm, Doshi went looking for his successor, and in the end decided to promote Movafaghi, who joined the company last year. Prior to Mixpanel, Movafaghi was CFO at software company Spiceworks and before that spent five years at Twitter in finance and global operations.Doshi said the one reference call he made before hiring Movafaghi was to former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo. At Twitter, Movafaghi was Costolo's right-hand man.""He was the Mr. Fixit at Twitter when there were a whole bunch of problems that others weren't willing to fix,"" Doshi said. ""He's the perfect person to lead Mixpanel into the future.""Mixpanel isn't confronting the kind of high-profile challenges Costolo faced at Twitter, which ranged from an abundance of bots and online bullying to slowing user growth and mounting losses. But the company has had its own set of hurdles.In 2014, when venture capitalists were throwing cash at anything with momentum, Mixpanel raised a big financing round from Andreessen Horowitz at a valuation of over $800 million. At the time, Mixpanel was primarily serving small and medium-sized businesses and other Y Combinator grads with analytics software that helped them understand their customers' behavior so they could get them to stick around for longer periods of time.But Mixpanel realized what so many business software start-ups eventually discover: The big money is in the enterprise. So in 2016, the company cut 19 jobs, or close to 10 percent of its workforce, almost exclusively in sales, and started to refocus on selling to bigger clients.The company has also dealt with incidents of data leaks. Most recently, TechCrunch reported in February that some people using sites monitored by Mixpanel had their passwords ""mistakenly pulled into its software.""Movafaghi said Mixpanel is ""in the ZIP code"" of $100 million in annual revenue after beating its internal fourth-quarter target by 54 percent. Close to half of its revenue now comes from companies with more than 1,000 employees, including BMW, Intuit, Samsung and Uber. Still, it's competing in a fragmented market against big companies like Google and Adobe as well as a host of start-ups.Of the $77 million Mixpanel has raised in venture funding, $60 million is still in the bank, Movafaghi said. Additional private capital is a possibility but Movafaghi said he's in no rush to raise money just because it's readily available.""One of the lessons learned over the last few years is companies were overcapitalized,"" he said. ""That has come back to really hurt a lot of businesses in the Valley.""Among Movafaghi's upcoming tasks is finding a CFO to replace him. Doshi, meanwhile, plans to take some time off and then return to Mixpanel in the role of executive director, which could include working on products and helping with recruiting.  Doshi said he wasn't under any pressure from the board to step down, and that ""there were multiple moments when they asked me if I was sure."" The company's board includes Affirm CEO and PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, whom Doshi calls one of his mentors.  tweetDoshi said he plans to spend more time tinkering around with side projects and getting back to programming. On Twitter, he often chimes in about his latest hobby — cryptocurrencies — though he's not ready to say if that will be part of his next gig.""I do plan to code a lot,"" he said. ""But I'm not sure if it's crypto."""
2018-05-09,Sears is working with Amazon to deliver and install car tires,0.08579736761554943,"Sears Holdings is taking its relationship with Amazon one step further. The department store chain announced Wednesday at its annual shareholders meeting in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, that it will offer full-service tire installation for orders from all tire brands on Amazon, including its own DieHard. News of the partnership sent Sears' stock soaring as much as 22 percent in early trading. The shares were last up 24 percent. The rollout will begin in the coming weeks for those customers who live within range of 47 Sears Auto Centers in eight metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. The service will eventually go live at Sears' more than 400 Auto Centers across the U.S., to reach more of Amazon's customers. The checkout process will look something like this, a Sears spokesman explained to CNBC: A customer selects the tires he or she wants, from any brand, on Amazon.  He or she selects ""Yes, I want these tires shipped to and installed at Sears Auto Center."" (The shipment of the tires to the Sears Auto Center would be handled by Amazon, not Sears.) The customer then provides three appointment times that are convenient for the installation. The chosen Sears Auto Center will then match the customer's schedule preferences with its appointment openings. Sears Auto Center then emails a confirmation through Amazon to the customer ahead of the appointment, which can still be altered. With any appointment, there will be a ""standard installation fee"" paid to Sears that covers installation, balancing, under hood/under car evaluation, a road safety test and other precautionary steps, the spokesman said. Sears kicked off its relationship with Amazon last summer when it announced it would begin selling Kenmore-branded appliances on Amazon, some of which are integrated with Amazon's Alexa platform. Shares of the department store chain had surged more than 25 percent on the news. Then, in December, Sears said it would begin selling merchandise from its DieHard brand on Amazon, including car batteries and now tires. ""Kenmore is now distributed nationally on Amazon with over 250 products and we are exceeding customer service level expectations,"" Tom Park, president of Kenmore, Craftsman and DieHard brands at Sears Holdings, said in a statement. The company said it has about 2,100 technicians at its Auto Centers across the country to perform tire installations. Sears is meanwhile looking for ways to monetize other assets, as its sales are in a steep decline overall and the company has more than $1 billion of debt coming due within the year, according to financial statements. Sears CEO Eddie Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments, has made a proposal to buy Kenmore, Sears' home improvement business, its PartsDirect division and some of the chain's real estate. Lampert has said he's been shopping some of those assets for years, but hasn't been able to find a serious buyer. In a blog post Wednesday, prior to Sears' shareholders meeting, Lampert said: ""We're still not where we need to be, and Sears continues to face significant challenges in a tough retail environment. ... The reality is transformation is an ongoing process and we are not done. I still firmly believe that, together, we can transform this company."" Sears Holdings shares are down nearly 70 percent from a year ago."
2018-06-12,Amazon's A.I. camera could help people with memory loss recognize old friends and family,0.006569664902998236,"Sachin Solkhan, a veteran software engineer who works with Fidelity Investments, has thought a lot about how technology can help people with dementia recognize their loved ones. So when Amazon launched its DeepLens camera in November 2017, he got the idea to use its artificial intelligence software to do just that. Ahead of the device's official launch later this week, he attended a hackathon on his own time to build a system that records a user's experiences and recognizes the person right in front of them. ""I wanted to find a way to use the device to help out someone who is struggling,"" he said.  DeepLens is Amazon's equivalent of Google's Clips ""smart"" camera, but it's targeted to developers instead of consumers. The idea is to use artificial intelligence technology to make it easier for the camera to do things like recognize objects or characters that appear in a video stream.Solkhan is hoping that people experiencing memory loss will someday carry around the camera with them wherever they go. Here's how it would work: The DeepLens system would store photographs and names of a user's family and friends in Amazon's cloud service. The camera would then record interactions. And if it all goes right, the AI would then recognize the person and issue a verbal prompt. Solkhan is testing it out with friends and family members as a side project. In recent years, Amazon has increasingly been looking for ways to use tools like artificial intelligence in health care for people with complex medical needs. The company isn't alone. Apple and Alphabet also see opportunities in health, a $3 billion sector that lags far behind other industries in adopting technology.""We see a lot of usage for machine learning from primary care to medical screening,"" Amazon's machine learning and AI general manager, Matt Wood, said in an interview with CNBC. Wood said the camera literally put Amazon's advanced technology, like machine learning and artificial intelligence, into the hands of developers. He described some of the first applications as ""fun,"" like recognizing species of pet dogs. But others are targeted to helping seniors and people with serious medical problems, like Solkhan's device. ""We're motivated to use it (machine learning) to improve elder care, and care in general,"" he said."
2018-06-22,Women speak of pervasive harassment in DC lobbying culture,0.04432666911461554,"She wanted a job, but it seemed the hiring partner wanted more.Olivia, a young consultant, was searching for a job in Washington when a firm expressed interest.But she remembers that the man interviewing her for the job, a senior partner, quickly veered into different territory. He insisted on taking her out for meals, with dinners accompanied by several bottles of wine.More from The Hill:'Fox & Friends' host on detained children: 'These aren't our kids'Planned Parenthood sues over Trump's changes to teen pregnancy prevention programSlavery apologies are empty rhetoric, not a real way forward""Every time I wanted to talk about work, or the position, or the job, he'd grab my hand and tell me, 'I just want to tell you how beautiful you are,' "" she said.""I was contemplating it as an opportunity, as a viable opportunity. It's ridiculous that I would consider something that would subject me to sexual harassment for higher title and higher pay,"" she said.On K Street — the term for Washington's cadre of lobbyists, political operatives and people working in public relations — deals are often done over dinner or drinks, on business travel or retreats.Much like Capitol Hill, the influence industry remains dominated by men, creating an environment where women say they are often subject to harassment and worse. Unlike in other industries, however, few women have been willing to come forward to talk about it.The Hill began reaching out to women on K Street last year, asking whether they had similar stories to those surfacing as part of the ""Me Too"" movement.More than a dozen women spoke about instances of sexual harassment or assault they say they have faced while working in the influence industry.Everyone interviewed by The Hill asked to talk anonymously in order to speak freely about their experiences, fearing they will be blacklisted in Washington. Their names have been changed to protect them.The employers are not named, nor are the men who they allege acted inappropriately.In addition to being apprehensive of hurting their future career prospects, some of the women are also worried about retaliation from the men themselves.""Everything in this town is predicated on relationships,"" said one woman who works in public relations (PR). ""Why make waves? That could be the next person to hire you.""Several of the women said working on K Street requires them to routinely deal with unwanted touching, inappropriate comments or text messages, and suggestive remarks about their bodies and appearances.All of them said they hoped sharing their experiences, however, would start a much-needed discussion about behavior by men in the influence industry and hopefully begin, as one woman described it, ""a course correction.""A lobbyist's job routinely involves travel around the country for fundraisers, advocacy and events. Women recounted experiences where, on occasion, alcohol-fueled socializing led to unwanted advances from colleagues, bosses and public officials.""When they are away from their district or on the road, they think it's a free-for-all, and their manners or morality is gone. It's out the window,"" said Allison, a lobbyist in her early 30s who said she has been harassed or assaulted by almost a dozen men, including other lobbyists and public officials, mostly when outside of Washington.During one trip to a political conference, Allison recalled how she and about 10 others decided to hang out poolside after a dinner and people went up to their hotel rooms to change.As she was getting ready with a friend, there was a knock at the door; it was another lobbyist attending the trip. Thinking he was there to walk down to the pool as a group, she opened the door to find him wearing an open robe with nothing underneath.""Let's go skinny dipping,"" Allison recounts him saying.When she recoiled, saying ""What the f---?,"" the lobbyist laughed and said the whole thing was a joke.""Harassment is sometimes about power,"" said Lisa Banks, a partner at Katz, Marshall & Banks who specializes in workplace harassment. ""There's a power differential in Washington, and most of those people are men. It's certainly an environment that's ripe for this, but it's also a horrible scenario.""Banks says her firm has recently seen an influx of complaints from women about experiences of harassment, but about half of the accusations have gone beyond the statute of limitations. Some women, she says, call to report things that happened decades ago.(Disclosure: Katz, Marshall & Banks recently represented a woman who accused D.C. celebrity chef Mike Isabella and other higher-ups in the restaurant group of harassment. This writer formerly worked at Kapnos, an Isabella-owned restaurant, but left before the suit began and was not involved.)Whether working in Washington or elsewhere, all the women who spoke with The Hill say that it is common for their colleagues to laugh off bad behavior, blaming it on alcohol or a ""boys will be boys"" attitude.Though some of the unsavory conduct described to The Hill occurred when alcohol was involved, other incidents did not.One month into a new trade association job, a board member invited Olivia to his hometown, a cross-country trip that was purportedly for work, where they were supposed to be setting the association's goals and strategizing for the next year. He asked her to pick out some things to do and shows to see while she was there.Once she arrived, the two began working in the hotel suite, and when it came time to go out for the evening, he asked to change in the bathroom.The executive, who was married, emerged from the bathroom shortly after that with his pants undone, according to Olivia.""He didn't solicit anything, but the innuendo was there,"" she added.While she managed to fend off his advances, she said his inappropriate behavior continued even after she returned home. He eventually ""got the hint,"" she says, though the two still had to work together.""It was one of the more horrifying experiences, because you just don't know how to rectify it,"" she said. ""I did tell colleagues and my immediate boss about it, and they laughed it off and said, 'That's how he is.' """"I feel fortunate that I had the confidence and the voice"" to push back, Olivia added. ""Not everyone has that luxury.""When women are harassed by board members or elected officials — those not employed by their own organization — coming forward about abuse can be complicated.After two receptions one night, a trade association lobbyist named Leslie recalled heading to another event in a group. A board member sat next to her and, despite being surrounded by others, tried to get her to kiss him.""He kept saying things like 'Why won't you just kiss me?' and 'Seriously, just kiss me right now,' "" she said. ""I climbed literally all the way over to the other side of the Uber. I was screaming 'I have a boyfriend! I have a boyfriend!' """"Not that [having a boyfriend] means anything,"" Leslie added.Employers are legally obligated to protect employees from abuse, regardless of whether the harasser is part of an organization, said Debra Katz, of Katz Marshall & Banks.""If they become aware that a board member, an elected official or even a [client] has acted inappropriately or sexually harassed an employee, the employer has the obligation to take corrective measures,"" Katz said. The employee must also agree on whatever actions are taken by the employer.In the corporate world, employers are seeking out answers on how to deal with harassment and make sure policies around it are ""state of the art,"" said Jason Schwartz, a lawyer specializing in employment law at Gibson Dunn.""A lot of lobbying and PR shops may not have a sophisticated, built-out [human resources] HR operation. A lot of this is unfamiliar territory to them,"" he said. ""People are struggling to figure out how to respond.""Rather than relying on a HR or legal department, Schwartz said some employers have opted to have an anonymous reporting system or designate a rotating employee as a safe person to confide in. Punishments are also important, he says.Some of Schwartz's clients have implemented a clause that employees' bonuses could be taken away should a negative report be made against them.""These kinds of concerns are being taken far more seriously now than they ever were,"" Schwartz said.But punishments become all the more complicated when it's the men in senior roles who are accused of misconduct, which makes reporting their behavior difficult.Some K Street offices, women say, have a hypermasculine culture that makes it hard to come forward.Human resources is there ""to protect management, they're not here to protect the people who report to them,"" said Liz, who worked for a trade association at the time. Her sentiment was echoed by nearly every woman who spoke to The Hill.""Anything you said to HR went immediately back to the manager, and you'd get called into the manager's office and get screamed at for going to HR.""Several women told The Hill that they've worked at firms where the men leading it talk repeatedly and openly about the women in the office, commenting on their bodies and their clothing in ways that go beyond innocent compliments.During presentations led by a woman at a large trade group, the men in the room would allegedly send each other explicit and vulgar text messages, according to a woman shown those messages by one of the men.Male members of the association allegedly passed a list ranking how much they wanted to sleep with women from the Washington office. It was called the ""f---ability factor"" list.They would ""love to come up and tell you if you've dropped off the list"" or if you've been relegated to a lower ranking by, for example, getting married, Liz recalled.Three other women told The Hill that men, including high-ranking government officials and executives, would send them explicit text messages — occasionally with graphic photos — talking about their bodies and what it would be like to have sex with them.In a trade association's Washington office, a man would habitually engage in phone sex during work hours, according to another man in the office who witnessed it.""Every afternoon, like clockwork, I would hear panting, heavy breathing,"" said Brandon, whose desk was near the executive's office. ""There were these conversations that registered above a whisper. ... When I listened closer, they were phone sex conversations.""A second person who worked in that office at the time described to The Hill similar conduct by this person. Allegedly, once a complaint had been filed, the man was made to reimburse the group for the cost of the calls.Margaret, a woman who then worked at a consulting firm, recalled that high-ranking executives would come to her office and talk about sexual conquests and whom they found attractive, sometimes giving unsolicited shoulder rubs.She called it ""harassment creep,"" where actions start small and escalate into increasingly inappropriate behavior.One ""would put his leg up on my desk and 'it' would be directly eye level with me,"" Margaret said. ""They want to see your reaction, to see how far they can take it with you.""Two women described a tactic utilized during greetings or staged photo ops with clients and association members — each pointing to elected officials as the worst offenders.""Rather than putting a hand here [while posing for a photo],"" said Margaret, grabbing her waist, ""it'll be up here."" She put her hand much higher, discreetly cupping the side of her breast.Another woman said one particular K Street executive would hug her in a similar way.""I call it the side-boob hug,"" she said. ""It is a pro trick. … I think they teach this when they get inaugurated. It has happened a bunch with elected officials. Or they find a way to grab your ass. It's amazing how often it happens.""One of the biggest issues surrounding the debate over sexual harassment in every industry is that women have different interpretations of what crosses the line.In an occupation where the job description involves being nice in order to push a cause or raise money, one lobbyist named Jennifer said that men often get the wrong impression. She said that other lobbyists she knows have propositioned her for sex.""I think it's terrible, but I feel less harassed and more like they are testing the waters because it must have worked for them before. As soon as I'm like, 'Uh, no,' they apologize,"" Jennifer said, adding, ""That's happened quite often, actually.""Legally, in most cases, unwanted comments or inappropriate touching must be continuous for an individual to file a lawsuit. The accusers must also show that the harmful environment was ""severe and pervasive,"" Katz said.One woman who worked at trade associations before joining a large K Street firm says she faced retaliation after coming forward about being harassed by a fellow lobbyist.An outside lobbyist hired by the organization where she worked pushed her against the wall of an elevator and tried to kiss her. Although he pulled back when she told him to stop, he began to send her a stream of text messages talking about how he wanted to be with her and how he was unhappy in his marriage.The lobbyist was close with other men in her office, and after she complained, her boss began to schedule lobbying outings involving things she hated and wouldn't do: golf and cigar smoking.""You don't have to terminate someone, but you can make their workplace a living hell,"" she said."
2018-08-01,"Now that taxes aren’t such a big worry, here’s what’s keeping investors up at night",0.08352891661715191,"With individual tax rates down, a new boogeyman is haunting investors: inflation worries.Those were the findings from the American Institute of CPAs' Personal Financial Satisfaction Index, which measures investors' ""financial pleasure"" or ""financial pain"" based on a range of economic factors, including personal taxes, inflation, job openings and real home equity.Overall, the Personal Financial Satisfaction Index has crept up to 27.7 in the second quarter, from 27.0 in the first three months of the year. This reflects increased job openings and strong stock market performance.However, inflation took the lead as a source of financial ""pain,"" edging out worries about taxes. The AICPA's blended inflation measure in the second quarter was 2.3 percent, up 0.6 percent from the first quarter.Up until the second quarter, taxes were the leading cause of ""pain"" for the prior eight quarters.""Even though inflation has gone up, it's still pretty darn low, relatively speaking,"" said Michael Eisenberg, a CPA, personal financial specialist and member of the American Institute of CPAs Consumer Financial Education Advocates.""People get nervous when they see or hear about inflation,"" he said. ""It eats away your purchasing power over time.""Here's what rising inflation means for your finances.Though inflation rises incrementally from one year to the next, the real concern is what it means, long-term, for your ability to pay for goods and services.It's one of the reasons why a pound of ground beef was $1.80 in June 1998 and why it's now $3.82 as of this June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.From a financial planning perspective, savers approaching retirement ought to identify the three biggest inflation threats facing them and prepare accordingly, said Thomas Scanlon, a CPA with Borgida & Co. in Manchester, Connecticut.""My big three are housing, education and medical,"" he said. ""Medical expenses are the runaway train and will affect everyone.""In order to safeguard against inflation in retirement, investors should work with their advisors to reevaluate their allocation toward equities so that they can keep up with rising expenses – particularly the cost of health care.""You could be in retirement for 30 years if you think about it, so even with benign inflation, you have to invest to protect yourself those last 15 years,"" said Scanlon.Incremental jumps in inflation may not be worth panicking over now, but investors should still be aware of what this might mean for other costs — credit-card debt, rent and the purchase of goods — particularly if paired with increases in the interest rate, said Eisenberg.Home in on those rising expenses by building a budget with your financial advisor and sticking to it. This will put the rising cost of living in context with your wages.""Budgeting is a great way to get people to be more knowledgeable about the expenses they have now and be aware of how they're saving or investing the surplus,"" said Eisenberg.More from Personal Finance Checking your credit score will not lower it 30 million Americans are not withholding enough tax.

2018-08-09,"These companies might close, lay off US workers because of Trump's trade war",0.07560835629017446,"The ongoing trade war President Donald Trump has waged against world powers, including some of our closest allies, doesn't show signs of slowing down.Left in the fray: Companies, American workers and consumers.The list of companies affected, either by planning to close plants, laying off employees, tossing out plans for new jobs or raising prices continues to grow.On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced it was escalating the battle with China by moving forward with a 25 percent tariff on $16 billion in Chinese goods. The tariffs will go into effect later this month.The end goal in Trump's eyes is for these countries to lower the tariffs they have on American goods, thus improving the market for the U.S. Some say his plan could work as the U.S. is negotiating from a position of strength -- a strong economy and low unemployment rates.But as the fight continues, some companies are having to absorb the blow. Several have raised prices or suffered lower profits while others announced the possible closing of plants, layoffs and halting plans to add jobs.More from USA Today: U.S. trade war with China, other countries: Layoffs, reduced hours, slimmer profitsTrump trade war: U.S. stock market is faring better than China's since dispute beganTariff winners and losers: How Trump's trade spat could affect shoppersHere's a list of some of the companies, sorted by state, who have announced effects from the tariffs:The nation's largest nail maker, Mid-Continent Nail, laid off 60 workers after sales plunged 70 percent in the aftermath of Trump imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel from Mexico and Canada. The Poplar Bluff company said it raised prices but customers defected. The company said it worries more layoffs will occur and that by Labor Day the entire 500-member workforce would be terminated.SEMO Box, a packaging company in Cape Girardeau, said it has felt a ripple effect from Mid-Continent's slowing business. The company said it would be laying off four temporary workers because of the slowdown, according to the Associated Press and Mid-Continent.Harley-Davidson plans to shift a portion of its U.S. motorcycle manufacturing outside the U.S. in response to the trade fight. The Milwaukee-based motorcycle manufacturer said Monday in a public filing that the move is necessary to preserve its second-biggest sales market after new tariffs were imposed by the European Union.The company did not specify whether it would close any U.S. plants or lay off any workers. But Harley recently mapped out plans to shift some production to a new factory in Thailand and said it would close its plant in Kansas City, Missouri, and add some jobs at a facility in York, Pennsylvania.About 100 employees were laid off from REC Silicon, which supplies silicon materials for solar panels, in the company's Moses Lake plant. The plant also cut production by 25 percent, according to Reuters.The layoffs were a ""direct result of the ongoing solar trade dispute between China and the United States,"" the company told Fortune. China has imposed tariffs on polysilicon, which the company relies on.Trans-Matic, of Holland, Michigan, shapes metal, mostly into auto parts, as well as components for door locks. The company has been forced to pay higher steel prices over the last few months due to the trade negotiations. Those higher costs have been passed down to its auto-supplier customers, some of which have scaled back their business.Company Chief Financial Officer Steve Patterson said his employees are getting slightly fewer hours and have seen a slight decline in profits.Tariffs could cost up to 4,000 new jobs at a new Volvo plant that opened in South Carolina. Volvo Cars Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters that the ""trade barriers and restrictions"" would prevent them from creating ""as many jobs as we are planning.""Element Electronics, a television-making company, said it might be forced to shut down its plant in Winnsboro unless certain items are removed from the tariff list that the company needs for production. The plant is one of the biggest job suppliers in Fairfield County and the company said it could be forced to lay off 126 people.Prices have increased at Vintage Industrial, a steel furniture company in Phoenix, because of the tariffs. Greg Hankerson, co-owner of the company, said the 25-percent tariff on imported steel has boosted raw-material costs, which forced him to raise prices 5 to 10 percent earlier this year for various items, with more price hikes possible.Many companies are holding out hope that the trade negotiations end quickly but have warned that job cuts and price increases could be imminent. BMW and General Motors sent their warnings in writing to the Department of Commerce.""This is hurting the economy but so far it's manageable,"" says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. ""If the war continues to escalate, it will do more damage and at some point it will undercut the good economy"" and trigger significant job losses and likely a recession.Despite fears that the trade dispute could spiral out of control, which would slow global growth and dampen investor and business confidence, Wall Street pros still believe the president's use of tariffs as a negotiating tool will likely be a winner.""Right or wrong, many investors still feel the U.S. has the upper hand in this battle and will win in the end,"" says Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.That's because China has more to lose. The country's exports to the U.S., measured in dollars, outnumber American exports to China 3 to 1. That buying power is tough to replace.And although tariffs could cause prices for consumer products ranging from cars to washing machines to rise, ""the U.S. does not need China as much as China needs the U.S.,"" says Barry Bannister, head of institutional equity strategy at Stifel."

2018-10-31,Musk shakes up SpaceX in race to make satellite launch window: Sources,0.12779442779442785,"SpaceX Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk flew to the Seattle area in June for meetings with engineers leading a satellite launch project crucial to his space company's growth.Within hours of landing, Musk had fired at least seven members of the program's senior management team at the Redmond, Washington, office, the culmination of disagreements over the pace at which the team was developing and testing its Starlink satellites, according to the two SpaceX employees with direct knowledge of the situation.Known for pushing aggressive deadlines, Musk quickly brought in new managers from SpaceX headquarters in California to replace a number of the managers he fired. Their mandate: Launch SpaceX's first batch of U.S.-made satellites by the middle of next year, the sources said.The management shakeup and the launch timeline, previously unreported, illustrate how quickly Musk wants to bring online SpaceX's Starlink program, which is competing with OneWeb and Canada's Telesat to be first to market with a new satellite-based Internet service.Those services - essentially a constellation of satellites that will bring high-speed Internet to rural and suburban locations globally - are key to generating the cash that privately-held SpaceX needs to fund Musk's real dream of developing a new rocket capable of flying paying customers to the moon and eventually trying to colonize Mars.""It would be like rebuilding the Internet in space,"" Musk told an audience in 2015 when he unveiled Starlink. ""The goal would be to have a majority of long-distance Internet traffic go over this network.""But the program is struggling to hire and retain staff, the employees said. Currently, about 300 SpaceX employees work on Starlink in Redmond, the sources said. According to GeekWire, Musk said in 2015 the Redmond operation would have ""probably several hundred people, maybe a thousand people"" after 3-4 years in operation.So far this year, about 50 employees left the company ""on their own accord,"" one of the SpaceX employees said, though the reason for those departures was unclear. Overall, SpaceX employs more than 6,000 staff.As of Tuesday, there were 22 job openings — including a job making espresso drinks — for the Redmond office, according to SpaceX's website.SpaceX spokeswoman Eva Behrend told Reuters the Redmond office remains an essential part of the company's efforts to build a next-generation satellite network.""Given the success of our recent Starlink demonstration satellites, we have incorporated lessons learned and re-organized to allow for the next design iteration to be flown in short order,"" Behrend said.She had no further comment on the reorganization or the launch window, but noted the strategy was similar to the rapid iteration in design and testing which led to the success of its rockets.Among the managers fired from the Redmond office was SpaceX Vice President of Satellites Rajeev Badyal, an engineering and hardware veteran of Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, and top designer Mark Krebs, who worked in Google's satellite and aircraft division, the employees said. Krebs declined to comment, and Badyal did not respond to requests for comment.The management shakeup followed in-fighting over pressure from Musk to speed up satellite testing schedules, one of the sources said. SpaceX's Behrend offered no comment on the matter.Culture was also a challenge for recent hires, a second source said. A number of the managers had been hired from nearby technology giant Microsoft, where workers were more accustomed to longer development schedules than Musk's famously short deadlines. Another senior manager that left SpaceX was Kim Schulze, who was previously a development manager at Microsoft, one of the people said. Schulze did not respond to a request for comment.""Rajeev wanted three more iterations of test satellites,"" one of the sources said. ""Elon thinks we can do the job with cheaper and simpler satellites, sooner.""A billionaire and chief executive officer of Tesla, Musk is known for ambitious projects ranging from auto electrification and rocket-building to high-speed transit tunnels.A Musk trust owns 54 percent of the outstanding stock of SpaceX, according to a 2016 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, SpaceX's most recent.SpaceX has said it would launch its satellites in phases through 2024. It goal of having Internet service available in 2020 is ""pretty much on target"" with an initial satellite launch by mid-2019, one of the sources said.OneWeb aims for a first launch between December and February 2019, while Telesat was targeting 2022 for broadband services.SpaceX employees told Reuters that two Starlink test satellites launched in February, dubbed Tintin A and B, were functioning as intended. The company is refining the orbital path of the satellites after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, which oversees satellites in orbit, approved a request from SpaceX to expand Tintins' altitude range, one of the sources said.The FCC confirmed SpaceX's modifications, which have not been reported previously, but declined further comment.""We're using the Tintins to explore that modification,"" one of the SpaceX employee sources said. ""They're happy and healthy and we're talking with them every time they pass a ground station, dozens of times a day.""SpaceX engineers have used the two test satellites to play online video games at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California and the Redmond office, the source said.""We were streaming 4k YouTube and playing 'Counter-Strike: Global Offensive' from Hawthorne to Redmond in the first week,"" the person added.In March, the FCC approved Musk's plan to beam down Internet signals from 4,425 small satellites launched into standard low-Earth orbit — more than two times the total number of active satellites there presently.One SpaceX engineer told Reuters the company has studied plans to add roughly 10,000 additional satellites after its first array is live to meet bandwidth demand in the coming 20 years. Behrend declined to comment on the plans and referred to a previous FCC filing, which states an additional 7,518 satellites are under consideration.Such a move would keep it in the race to expand affordable high-speed Internet access to billions of people in rural or suburban areas globally. The Satellite Industry Association, a lobby group, estimates the global market for satellite-based broadband and television services is worth $127.7 billion, dwarfing the roughly $5.5 billion satellite launch services market.McLean, Virginia-based OneWeb is working to provide internet service from roughly 900 satellites after raising more than $2 billion from SoftBank, the Coca-Cola Company and others.Telesat, backed by Loral Space & Communications Inc, said on Oct. 23 it conducted the first-ever live test of in-flight broadband via a satellite in low-Earth orbit, and was targeting 2022 for broadband services from a constellation of some 300 satellites.SpaceX aims to provide Internet service by linking its satellites to ground stations and mountable terminals about the size of a pizza box at homes or businesses, according to the FCC filing. The U.S. market for broadband is already dominated by several incumbent communications companies, including NBCUniversal and CNBC parent Comcast. Comcast declined to comment on the potential new competition.While SpaceX's model of reusing rockets has generated cash, it is not enough to cover the roughly $5 billion cost to develop its Big Falcon Rocket that Musk wants one day to fly to Mars.""There had to be a much bigger idea for generating cash to basically realize the Mars plans,"" said one of the SpaceX employees. ""What better idea than to put Comcast out of business?""WATCH: This Brooklyn startup wants to make spacesuits at a fraction of NASA's cost"

2019-01-08,Trump's options on emergency funding for the border range from a fight over a few miles of fence to a bruising constitutional war over a wall,0.021385032591929143,"As the White House descends further into chaos, no one can discern President Donald Trump's next move until he makes it.But Trump and administration aides have signaled that he views a presidential declaration of emergency as an exit ramp from the standoff with Congress that has shut down a large chunk of the government for 18 days now. It would, simultaneously, let him assent to reopening federal agencies and assert unilateral authority to order construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.Bracing for Trump's decision, congressional aides in both parties say the potential scope of presidential action ranges from very big to very small.A president's authority to declare a national emergency gives him the power to redirect taxpayer funds Congress has already approved. In conversations with lawmakers, the White House has pointed toward two different pots of Pentagon money. One, containing less than $1 billion, is for curtailing drug shipments. The other, containing $22 billion, is for military construction projects.The military construction pot might even be enough to pay for whatever barrier Trump wants across the 2,000-mile border, whether constructed of concrete or steel or something else. If Trump goes big, he could announce his intention to do exactly that.Yet the bigger he goes, the bigger the backlash he risks.An emergency declaration related to border control would face immediate legal challenges, just as his attempt to ban travel into the United States from some majority-Muslim countries did. The more miles of wall Trump attempts to build under an emergency declaration, the more potential challengers — Congress, private landowners, affected local governments.Moreover, a recent 17-page report to Congress shows that the pot of military construction money contains funds previously designated for projects across the country. That would ensure resistance from both red and blue states eager for those projects. And at a time when Trump speaks openly about the prospect of impeachment proceedings, the weak factual basis for a border emergency claim would invite House Democrats to assert an unconstitutional abuse of executive power.But a little-noticed administration maneuver last fall points to a far more limited possibility.It could be completed by only touching the small pot of anti-drug money. It wouldn't require diverting cash from military construction projects elsewhere. It would only affect 31 miles of the Mexican border on a federal explosives-testing site in Arizona.Last fall, the Pentagon informed Congress that the Navy had committed $7.5 million to ""advance planning and survey efforts"" for new and improved border barriers on the Barry M. Goldwater Range. Calling the range ""a known drug-smuggling corridor,"" Assistant Defense Secretary Kenneth Rapuano wrote that such barriers ""will both protect BMGR from such illegal activity and address human life and safety concerns by deterring unlawful entry onto an active bombing range.""In an October letter to Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, who now chairs the House Armed Services Committee, Rapuano said no construction had occurred on the range. But he noted that the administration was ""reviewing its authority and funding options.""Expressing strong opposition, Smith and his Democratic colleagues estimated that the 31 miles' worth of barrier along the range would cost $450 million. The anti-drug account that the Pentagon might try to tap contains $760 million, according to a Republican congressional aide.Trump has the opportunity to clarify his intentions in a televised prime-time address on the issue Tuesday. If recent form holds, lawmakers will find out at the same time everyone else does."
2019-01-11,Amazon and Google are going to be in every aspect of your life whether you want them to or not,0.24870129870129867,"Until recently, Amazon and Google competed for presence in our homes through their own gadgets: Smart speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, TV add-ons like Chromecast and Fire TV and even home security systems like Nest and Ring.But, at CES 2019, that competition was brought to a boil as partners from both companies launched dozens of products that will bring Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant into nearly every aspect of our lives.I've been attending CES for more than a decade, and it's always home to all sorts of new doohickeys, from robots to health trackers and the latest in TV technology. While those things were all on display this year, too, I couldn't help but notice the massive presence of Google and Amazon, two companies that didn't even exist at CES a couple of years ago. That's because their smart assistants, the ones you can control by voice, are being built into almost every category of new product that was introduced at CES, from TVs to ovens — even lawnmowers and a toilet.Google tripled the size of its booth this year, where it even had a roller coaster that brought riders through an experience that explained how you can use Google Assistant throughout the day, from getting directions and traffic information to ordering food and snapping a selfie.Amazon had three different booths. There was one for ""Key by Amazon,"" which showed how you can have packages delivered inside your house, into your car and — new this year — into your garage. It also had a booth dedicated to Ring, its home security system, that showed off a range of new products like security cameras and lights. Amazon also had an entire room where it had an array of products from its partners, including smart glasses, coffee machines, ovens and more, all with Alexa built-in.Both firms also revealed how widespread their ecosystems are.Google said that by the end of January, more than 1 billion devices will have Google Assistant built-in. That's up from 500 million in May, but a lot of that growth is because Assistant now ships as a standard feature on Android phones. Google Assistant is also built into 10,000 different smart home devices from more than 1,600 brands, the company said.Amazon said there are now more than 150 products with Alexa built directly in — which means you can talk right to it without also owning an Echo — and more than 28,000 products from 4,500 brands that support it. That means you need an Amazon Echo to control the gadget. Amazon also said it has now sold more than 100 million Alexa devices.There's a reason the number of products that support the assistants is skyrocketing.Last year, Amazon introduced a developer kit that made it much easier for partners to add Alexa to their devices. It showed this with a proof of concept microwave that it now sells. If a partner decides to add Amazon Dash integration, then it can be used to automatically order more supplies when you run low, like more detergent for your Alexa-powered dishwasher. Google also introduced similar tools for developers.By pure booth presence alone, Google left the biggest impression on me at CES. I've just never seen a roller coaster in a booth. But, and this was clear walking around the show, more brands and products were on display with Amazon Alexa on board. Some supported both.For consumers, this means that as you shop for new products in the coming years, whether it's a car or TV or a home appliance, you'll probably see Alexa or Google built-in, even if you don't necessarily want to use it. If you do, you'll be able to tell Alexa to start the dishwasher or ask Google to set your oven to 375 degrees.And this means that Amazon and Google are becoming nearly omnipresent, whether you want them to be or not. Since Alexa and Google Assistant learn from what you ask of them, that means Amazon and Google will be able to learn more than ever about you and your habits. And for them, that's big business. It gives Amazon the ability to gather data on your purchasing habits and recommend more items you're likely to buy. And Google will learn more about you for its targeted advertising business."
2019-02-01,"European stocks close higher amid earnings, US jobs report; Wirecard plummets 25%",0.07160601026880097,"European stocks closed higher Friday, as market participants monitored a flurry of corporate results and key economic reports.The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed provisionally up by 0.29 percent, with most sectors and major bourses in positive territory.Household goods stocks were among the top gainers, led by Sweden's Electrolux. The home appliances maker surged close to the top of the European benchmark after posting stronger-than-anticipated quarterly results and forecast easing cost headwinds over the coming months. Shares of the company were up over 10 percent.Europe's banking index led the losses amid earnings news. Deutsche Bank reported its first full-year net profit in four years on Friday. However, shares came under pressure, losing 0.59 percent as Germany's largest lender continues to face growing merger speculation and a series of uphill struggles.Germany's Wirecard, meanwhile, plummeted 25 percent after a Financial Times report said an external firm commissioned by the payments firm to investigate its Singapore office found evidence indicating ""serious offences or forgery and/or of falsification of accounts."" Wirecard called the report ""inaccurate, misleading and defamatory.""On the data front, euro zone inflation slipped as expected last month. Official data published Friday showed inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro slowed to 1.4 percent in January, from 1.6 percent a month earlier. It provides another reason for the European Central Bank to ease off removing stimulus, as inflation falls further away from its target.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 160 points while the  and Nasdaq Composite also saw gains.Market focus was largely attuned to the latest jobs numbers out of the U.S. Non-farm payrolls released by the Labor Department Friday showed that the U.S. economy added 304,000 jobs in January, beating an expected 170,000.Analysts had been unsure what to expect in the wake of the recent government shutdown but stronger-than-expected jobs growth pointed to underlying strength in the U.S. economy.Sentiment was shaken by concerns over global trade developments, especially after a survey on Chinese factory activity fell to its lowest level since February 2016.The downbeat data exacerbated fears of an economic slowdown and dented optimism over a possible U.S.-China trade deal.China's trade delegation reportedly said Washington and Beijing had made ""important progress"" after two days of trade negotiations.President Donald Trump also said he would soon meet with Chinese premier Xi Jinping to try to reach a comprehensive trade deal. Stocks had taken heart from the possibility of top-level trade talks over the coming weeks, but the upbeat mood soon cooled when the White House insisted it sees March 1 as a hard deadline for a deal."
2019-02-08,Banks in Europe struggle to find talent with US rivals paying top dollar,0.05602945341263097,"European banks are finding it hard to recruit the right people due to new regulations and intense competition from some of their U.S. peers, industry insiders have told CNBC.""It is a vicious circle, isn't it?"" a senior executive at a European bank told CNBC who preferred to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the topic.""You want to hire the right talent because you can see the business is suffering, but you don't get approvals for the headcount and when you finally do, you aren't able to match the salaries,"" they told CNBC.Pay in the banking sector is generally higher compared to other industries. A junior-level analyst in a trading role at a European bank can start at anything between $50,000 to $60,000 for a base salary. On top of this they would receive allowances and a bonus, which can sometimes be given in the form of company shares.This is where U.S. banks differ as they tend to stick to cash bonuses, taking the overall compensation of a junior analyst to somewhere between $80,000 to $100,000. This gap starts to widen more as employees go up the ladder.People outside the industry have often found these figures to be shocking, especially as the world economy is undergoing uncertainty and still reeling from the effects of the financial crisis of 2008. Banks are often criticized for big payouts and new rules on salary caps in Europe hasn't stopped that.""I think we are seeing some incentive systems in some corners of the financial sector, yet again, moving in the direction that I find not exactly aligned with the sense of purpose that I hope banks actually have,"" Christine Lagarde, the managing director of International Monetary Fund, said at a CNBC-moderated panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. She also advised the financial sector to work with a sense of purpose and not ""single-mindedly"" for the pursuit of profits.European banks have to adhere to an EU-wide bonus cap that was put in practice in early 2014. The regulation limits bonuses paid to senior managers and other ""material risk takers"" to no more than 100 percent of their fixed pay generally, or 200 percent of their fixed pay with shareholders' approval.While this limit may have calmed an uproar over the large sums of money that executives take home, it has also led to banks increasing basic salaries as a way to compensate for the bonus restrictions.""One consequence of the regulation of remuneration, particularly the introduction in the EU of the bonus cap, has been an increase in fixed remuneration as a proportion of total remuneration,"" a Bank of England report published in December 2015 found.In 2015, the Bank of England and the Prudential Regulation Authority, also made changes around bonus buyouts, where banks compensate new employees for any remuneration foregone when they change jobs. As part of the new rules, banks can claw back some or all of the bonus already paid to an employee for up to seven years, if the employee is found to have committed wrongdoing in their previous job.The EU-wide bonus cap saw an impact not just on employee morale but also on hiring. Big European banks found it difficult to hire executives, especially when compared to U.S. banks where bonuses and fixed salaries can be higher.European banks are suffering from years of weak profits, massive fines, ultra-low monetary policy and uncertainty surrounding the U.K.'s exit from the European Union. The U.S. banks, on the other hand, especially the big ones like J.P. Morgan and Citi have very strong retail operations that have kept these banks resilient in the face of economic headwinds. This makes them better paymasters and a more conducive place to work.One recruitment consultant told CNBC, on condition of anonymity due to their relationship with large banks, that lenders like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan see strong bonus payouts for front of office roles executives — such as in the trading room — and were up to 30 to 40 percent better when compared to European banks such as Barclays, Deutsche Bank and UBS. Spokespersons for Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Deutsche Bank were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan and UBS declined to comment.""There is no comparison. A vice-president or a director level executive in a trading function at a U.S. bank will easily see a 100 percent cash bonus component as compared to a European bank where these are generally given as deferred, or in stocks,"" the consultant said.Banks pay out bonuses in various ways. While some banks, especially the U.S. banks, pay out a 100 percent cash bonus, several European banks pay out bonuses as a mix of cash and stocks. The cash component of the bonus, in many cases, is deferred and is paid out over a longer period — an incentive for the employee to stay with the company and a way for the institution to deal with costs.""I think that was the case three or four years ago, but we started to see the stronger European banks catch up last year to pay market levels,"" Joseph Leung, the founder and managing partner at recruitment firm Aubreck Leung, told CNBC last week.""Keep in mind many of them exited unprofitable businesses a few years ago and redistributed their capital to performing areas enabling them to pay their good people,"" Leung added.He, however, warned that this could change in 2019 since none of the European banks have announced their compensations yet.Amid all the uncertainty currently surrounding the banking sector, it is the new talent that is bearing the brunt. Young people joining banks often find themselves witnessing a massive income divide when compared with their senior peers who have climbed up the ladder pre-crisis and bonus-cap era.While some employees at European banks may feel disappointed with low pay and non-existent bonuses, others may feel comfortable with a steady flow of income — that is comparatively higher than what several other sectors pay.""Banks have been paying like this for years so don't think its affected morale in any way,"" Leung said.""Because of the bonus cap most people have seen their fixed compensation gone up — whether it's in a higher basic salary or in allowances ... So in a warped way some are actually getting more cash than they did before because they are getting less deferred stock."""
2019-03-03,Bryce Harper's $330 million Phillies contract can't solve baseball's bigger spending problem,0.10365188292948035,"Major League Baseball spring training is underway and some of the biggest concerns about spending by teams headed into the MLB season have now been addressed, with roughly $1 billion spent on new player contracts within the last two weeks. On Thursday, all-star outfielder Bryce Harper signed a 13-year, $330 million contract with the Philadelphia Phillies, the largest contract in MLB history in total value, though not per-year salary. The week previous, the San Diego Padres doled out $300 million over 10 years to Manny Machado. The Colorado Rockies also resigned Nolan Arenado to an eight-year, $260 million contract; the New York Yankees gave outfielder Aaron Hicks a seven-year, $70 million deal; and the St. Louis Cardinals starter Miles Mikolas received four years and $68 million.But bigger problems persist for the MLB: Attendance is down, games are still too long, and the gap between the richest and poorest teams remains wide, leading to a lack of competitiveness from many teams .Eight major league teams experienced double-digit attendance losses in 2018, led by the Miami Marlins' 52 percent decline — the laggard was no surprise, as the Marlins traded both 2017 National League Most Valuable Player Giancarlo Stanton to the New York Yankees and Christian Yelich to the Milwaukee Brewers (who went on to win the 2018 National League MVP award) before the season began, as part of the beginning of a long rebuilding process.Several currently successful teams embraced a rebuilding process, such as the 2017 World Series champion Houston Astros and 2016 World Series champion Chicago Cubs. The Padres will be another test case this season: The team inked the Machado deal after amassing what is widely regarded as one of the best farm systems in baseball, but also after close to a decade of consistently poor results on the field — the team has not had a winning record since 2010 and has not made the playoffs since 2006.Like the Padres' 66-96 record last season, there have been several other teams who have drowned in losses, mostly from stripping talent away, attempting to rebuild younger and cheaper rosters. The Baltimore Orioles went 47-115 last season; the Chicago White Sox and Cincinnati Reds have both had five or more straight losing seasons since 2014.Stephen J.K. Walters, a professor of economics at Loyola University Maryland and former economic advisor to MLB teams, said mid- and small-market teams are taking an approach that is defensible. ""The current amount of competitive imbalance — for example, Baseball Prospectus forecasts that only 5 of 15 American League teams will have winning records, with 82 wins or more — is chiefly a result of mid- and small-market teams' acceptance of the idea that they can get away with boring their fans for a few years as also-rans while they hoard high draft picks and prospects, and then they'll be good and all will be forgiven.""According to Roto Champ, the Padres now have the second-best prospect in baseball with Fernando Tatis Jr., a 20-year-old shortstop from the Dominican Republic and son of a former major leaguer. The Padres, White Sox, Reds and Rays possess a combined seven of the top 20 players on Roto Champ's list.Under the current Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), revenue sharing dollars have to be utilized in effort to try and improve winning but that does not necessarily mean those dollars have to be invested in free agency. The MLB commissioner may require a team to submit a report that details its efforts to win over the next two years if he feels that team has violated any of the rules that come along with the revenue sharing procedure.Last year, the MLB Players Association filed grievances against the Tampa Bay Rays, Miami Marlins, Pittsburgh Pirates and Oakland Athletics, claiming each team did not spend its revenue sharing money in the expected manner.In the Moneyball era, spending smart on talent doesn't have to mean spending the most and there are examples of tighter-wad teams performing on the field at a high level. The Athletics made the playoffs last season, losing to the Yankees in the American League wild card round. The Rays won 90 games, but fell short of clinching a playoff spot. Each of these team's 2018 payrolls was below $90 million and this year seems to be heading in the same direction. These four teams rank towards the bottom (25-30) of team payroll trackings, with the Rays at a league low just above $51 million.MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred addressed the grievances during a recent spring training appearance with the Pittsburgh Pirates president Frank Coonelly. ""Tony Clark (MLBPA Director of Player Relations) started the assertion that teams aren't trying to win by singling out four teams,"" Manfred said, according to a report in the Pittsburgh Gazette. ""He did a very poor job with those teams. One won 97 games, another won 90, and the other was a game above .500, right Frank (Coonelly)? Two games above .500. Our teams are trying. They all want to win."" Manfred added, ""This narrative that our teams aren't trying is just not supported by the facts. Our teams are trying. Every single one of them wants to win. It may look a little different to outsiders because the game has changed. The way people think about putting a winning team together has changed. But that doesn't mean they're not trying.""Walters said part of the competitive balance problem is the revenue sharing model used by the MLB.""The fix: a requirement that the bulk of revenue-sharing receipts gets spent on major-league talent,"" he said. ""In any case, competitive balance is more about 'compression' of spending on payroll. … To encourage those low-spending, small-market teams to buy a little more talent, I'd tweak MLB's revenue-sharing formula. It's complicated, but right now money gets distributed based on market size, but if it was a combination of market size and wins, that would breathe more life into the free agent market.""In effect, it would incentivize smaller market teams to spend more on players and create a positive feedback loop in which spending more would result in receiving more from revenue sharing.""Optimal revenue sharing is an empirical question because it ultimately depends on the supply-side objectives of club owners throughout the league. Owners range from being profit maximizers who are only in it for the money to sportsmen gamers who are only in it to win it,"" said John Vrooman, an economics professor at Vanderbilt University.But not all economists agree that revenue sharing is broken, or even, the root of the problem. David Berri, professor of economics at Southern Utah University and the author of ""Sports Economics"" views a limited population of talent rather than revenue sharing as the primary reason for the competitive imbalance.""Baseball was not competitive in the first half of the 20th century because the talent pool was restricted (only white males from the U.S. played). Racial integration and a global search for talent expanded the talent pool and made the game much more competitive,"" Berri said.None of this is to say the business of baseball is not a financial success. In fact, the MLB is flush with cash. The league grossed $10.3 billion in 2018, the 16th-consecutive year that the league saw record gross revenue, according to a widely cited annual Forbes report based on information provided from league sources to baseball writer Maury Brown. And despite a 4.1 percent attendance drop in 2018, television broadcasts for twelve major league teams ranked first in their market in primetime, according to Major League Baseball.The MLB saw a five-year viewership high on its Fox package, which in part contributed to a seven-year extension with Fox Sports, continuing to air World Series and All Star games through 2028, an extension worth a reported $5.1 billion.The MLB also was ahead of professional sports league peers in its development of streaming technology, a forward-thinking effort that ultimately resulted in Disney's billion-dollar-plus purchase of BAMTech, the MLB's internet start-up, now valued at close to $4 billion.Although the MLB has crowned eight different World Series winners in the last 10 years, it has for the most part been a similar set of teams making the playoffs each year. The Los Angeles Dodgers (who lost in the last two World Series) have consistently won the National League West since 2013. The Boston Red Sox (the current World Series champion), have won four titles since 2004. And the New York Yankees, another money spending powerhouse, have only missed the playoffs four times since 2008. These teams are consistently atop league leaders in payrolls.Despite competing for a good majority of last season, the Phillies faded down the stretch, finishing the season with an 80-82 record.

2019-03-25,"Everybody's missing how Apple's 'subtle' approach could drive its stock higher, says tech investor Gene Munster",0.014499278499278494,"Apple's big event may have failed to impress investors on Monday — but those investors are actually missing the point of the tech giant's new services, tech investor Gene Munster told CNBC on Monday.Shares of Apple closed down 1.2 percent after the highly anticipated event, which introduced its streaming video service Apple TV+, a paid news service Apple News+ , a credit card and a gaming service called Arcade. Apple did not announce many details about the services, including pricing for TV+ and Arcade. But Munster says investors who focus on the missing details are missing the bigger picture.""What Apple is saying is they are going to take things that we interact with every day -- whether it's the streaming service, gaming or our credit card – and we're going to try to change in terms how people use that. The language that they use is 'enriching people's lives,'"" said Munster, founder of the venture capitalist firm Loup Ventures.That means creating content that isn't typical, gaming that's healthier, and a credit card that adds transparency, he added.""That gets lost in the conversation today — these subtle little approaches that Apple does to make our lives just a little bit better. And I think that ultimately is going to yield a higher share price,"" Munster said on ""Fast Money.""Apple is entering a crowded field of original programming, going up against established names like Netflix and Amazon. In its announcement on Monday, Apple called on big names like Steven Spielberg, Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carrell, Oprah Winfrey and Jennifer Aniston to discuss their upcoming shows.The tech giant didn't say how many programs they have or how much the service would cost.Munster said Apple probably has about 40 shows and movies — a ""far cry"" from Netflix's library. However, he still thinks Apple's foray into the space will hurt Netflix's stock.""The quality of this is what is going to ultimately stand out and I suspect that the way that Apple is going to measure their success is the number of industry awards,"" he said. ""This content, this different approach is going to have an impact and I think that that could be a similar size as Netflix, call it $15 billion a year""Munster is projecting the four services together will yield about $20 billion or so in revenues in the next five years.—CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.Disclaimer"
2019-03-27,Investors on pace to plow a record amount of money into corporate bonds in March,0.11093588950731804,"Investors are barreling toward the bond market as inflows look to break a new monthly record.Inflows to U.S. high-grade funds and exchange-traded funds have averaged $846 million per day in March, ahead of the $800 million average during the record month last year, according to research from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The previous record for corporate bond inflows was $38.4 billion in January 2018.""Based on daily fund and ETF inflows, March is on track to set a new monthly record,"" Bank of America credit strategists Yuri Seliger and Yunyi Zhang wrote Wednesday.""Inflows this year have been delayed relative to earlier periods of strong bond price appreciation,"" the strategists added. ""Given the more stable macro conditions currently flows catching up to the historical trend could provide another catalyst for stronger inflows.""The iShares iBoxx Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, just one of many such funds, has alone seen inflows of more than $600 million in the past month and about $440 million since the start of March.The pivot into investment-grade debt comes as a growing number of economists and investors believe the U.S. economy is poised for a slowdown in the next year. Yields of ranging quality have been under pressure ever since the Federal Reserve downgraded its forecast for the American economy last week, when it decided to leave its overnight lending rate unchanged.Some investors may view corporate debt as a somewhat safer bet over a volatile equity market despite sharp gains in the S&P 500 this year. Though the broad, large-cap index is up more than 11 percent this year, fund flows have not kept pace. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF, one of the largest in the world with over $260 billion under management, has seen outflows of more than $10 billion since the year began.""Data arriving since September suggest that growth is slowing somewhat more than expected,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week. ""While the U.S. economy showed little evidence of slowdown through the end of 2018, the limited data we have so far this year have been somewhat more mixed.""The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note is down more than 25 basis points since last Monday, falling under the rate on the 3-month Treasury bill. On the corporate side, companies in the U.S. have taken advantage of low interest rates both to grow business and reward shareholders, ballooning their own debt sums.""Flows follow returns and the drop in interest rates since Monday of last week should encourage potentially even stronger inflows in April,"" Seliger and Zhang added.While companies have thus far been able to find buyers for their debt, many market participants are keeping a close eye for changes in the economy and confidence. Both February payrolls data and March consumer confidence disappointed investors recently, pressuring investors out of equities and into safer markets like debt.Total corporate debt has swelled from nearly $4.9 trillion in 2007 as the Great Recession was just starting to break out to nearly $9.1 trillion halfway through 2018, quietly surging 86 percent, according to Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association data."
2019-04-30,"Central banks have almost eliminated recessions, venture capitalist Palihapitiya says",0.03217857142857143,"Central banks have created an environment where both major downturns as well as expansions are almost impossible, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya said Tuesday.A well-known investor across a multitude of areas, including as a very early Facebook executive and a big proponent of cryptocurrencies, Palihapitiya told CNBC that entities like the Federal Reserve have used quantitative easing to stage-manage an essentially stagnant economy.""I don't see a world in which we have any form of meaningful contraction nor any form of meaningful expansion,"" he told CNBC's Scott Wapner during a ""Fast Money Halftime Report"" segment. ""We have completely taken away the toolkit of how normal economies should work when we started with QE. I mean, the odds that there's a recession anymore in any Western country of the world is almost next to impossible now, save a complete financial externality that we can't forecast.""A lack of downturns is not necessarily a good thing, Palihapitiya added, and he criticized central banks for refusing to allow normal economic cycles to play out.""Central bankers have lost all intestinal fortitude to actually put a country through a recession, because it's actually regenerative and useful,"" he said. ""Even if they had the wherewithal to do it, the political infrastructure will just completely absorb that intent. So we are probably not, save of something crazy, going to see massive, massive negative growth except in countries that are so fundamentally crippled that they tip over.""For investors, that means a limited menu of choices.""So the reality is we're going to grow low single digits every year, which means there's no growth anywhere else, which means you're better off buying equities and you're better off buying equities that are substantively ones that are sort of the deflationary stocks, the cheaper, faster better stocks, the tech stocks,"" he said.Palihapitiya is CEO of Social Capital and he also is a minority stakeholder and board member of the NBA's Golden State Warriors."
2019-05-05,Review: The 2019 Toyota Tundra pickup fails to impress,0.13131499726327311,"The full-size pickup truck market has never been hotter, with Fiat Chrysler's Ram and General Motor's Chevy duking it out second place in sales behind Ford. All three big American companies are constantly refreshing their lineups to cling to any advantages over the competition.That's big trouble for Toyota, which hasn't completely redesigned its Tundra pickup since 2007. It's received a slew of updates and a large refresh in 2014, but sales have always lagged behind the big three in Detroit. In a segment of six, the Tundra is the fifth-place finisher, besting only Nissan's Titan in sales.After a week with one, it's not hard to see why. It's well built and isn't as pricey as the American trucks, but we still wouldn't recommend one.As of last week, there have now been two Toyota Tundras of this generation that have reached one million miles on their original transmissions. That's a seriously impressive feat, a testament to the reputation Toyota trucks have long maintained for unbeatable reliability.Part of that comes from simplicity. For the buyers that bemoan Ford moving toward turbocharging, Ram putting in mild-hybrid systems and GMC offering tailgates that fold in a variety of ways, the Tundra's old-school style may be refreshing.It's got a 5.7-liter V-8 linked to a six-speed transmission, providing 381 horsepower. It's not the most powerful engine in its class, but it offers more than enough power to work in day-to-day life without taxing the motor. There's enough reserve power that it'd be fine loaded up with gear, people and a trailer.Plus — though Toyota still has a lot to learn from American trucks in other categories — the Japenese company has certainly matched the in-your-face, bombastic styling of the big three. The Tundra looks like a sledgehammer, with a broad and aggressive face and oversized details. Our $46,610 tester looked alright, but in TRD Pro guise the Tundra is a mean looking machine.It also came in about $17,000 cheaper than the last Ram we tested, though it was significantly lighter on feature content and lacked the Ram's crew cab, bed liner and integrated bed cargo system. Credit to Toyota, though, for including active safety features like forward collision warning in all Tundras.The downside of two current-generation Tundras having hit one million miles is that it draws attention to just how long the truck has been on sale. In a rapidly changing market, the Tundra feels ancient. It's by far the oldest vehicle in the segment. The infotainment system is far behind the competition; Ram offers a 12-inch portrait touch screen, but Toyota makes do with a screen that looks largely the same as it did in 2014. The interior materials are hard plastics that look cheap and it's behind on tech.Most notably, the newest crop of huge trucks offer 360-degree cameras and self-parking systems to help drivers manage the behemoths. The Tundra doesn't, a shame since it feels more unwieldy than other full-size trucks.It lumbers around without a sense of poise or refinement, making it hard to place the truck where you want it. It, of course, didn't help that the Tundra we tested was equipped with the longer bed option. Even still, the handling was poor.Power, as mentioned, was adequate. Unfortunately, the old-school way that the Tundra makes the power isn't particularly efficient. The Tundra with the 5.7-liter V-8 is rated for 17 miles per gallon on the highway, while a Ram 1500 with a 5.7-liter V-8 is good for 21 mpg on the highway. Add the eTorque mild hybrid option and that climbs to 22 mpg.And then it comes to luxury. Pickup truck buyers are increasingly opting for more expensive, more optioned trucks. The Tundra offers none of the refinement of the luxurious trims of the competition and the options list is significantly shorter.Of course, longtime truck buyers might not care about tech or luxury features. Complaining about those things may come off as missing the point. And to some extent, they're right. If the Tundra was more capable than its rivals, a lot could be forgiven.Unfortunately, it's not. The Tundra is not the most powerful, it doesn't tow the most and it doesn't have a higher payload capacity than its rivals. Rivals also offer more engine choices, more cab configurations and things like corner steps and in-bed locking storage that make work duties more manageable.The Tundra makes sense for some buyers. If your primary focus is on reliability, there's a solid argument to be made that this is the most dependable vehicle on sale. If you are fine with the options it offers, it can also undercut similarly equipped trucks from the Detroit brands.But you'll always be aware of the lower price. The Tundra feels substantially cheaper than rival trucks. It's not as comfortable, quiet or livable. It feels clumsy, unlike the pseudo-luxury experiences offered by top-trim rivals.It's also not the most capable or configurable truck. We can't argue that it's unbelievably reliable and extremely well built, but in a fiercely competitive segment that isn't enough to offset the Tundra's downsides.Exterior: 3.5Interior: 1.5Driving experience: 2Value: 2.5Overall: 2.4Price as tested: $46,610*Ratings out of 5"
2019-05-13,Slack says it's going to replace email and is as necessary as electricity in its pitch to investors,0.16703192640692638,"Business messaging service Slack briefed investors on Monday, as the company expects to go public with a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange on June 20.Slack provided updated information in an amendment to its initial public offering filing ahead of its pitch to investors. For the quarter ending April 30, Slack brought in revenue estimated between $133.8 to $134.8 million, up from $80.9 million in the same period a year ago. Slack's net loss expanded to about $39 million in the quarter, from $26.3 million.The service, which primarily caters to businesses, said it has more than 10 million users as of January. In its briefing to investors, Slack said it will release first quarter earnings and host a conference call on June 10, as well as give a second quarter forecast.Stewart Butterfield, co-founder and CEO of Slack, made the case that replacing email with Slack changes the way employees of a company communicate.""This shift is inevitable. We believe every organization will switch to Slack or something like it,"" Butterfield said in a presentation.He also pitched Slack as a software-focused company that believes the world is ""only at the beginning"" of its reliance on software. In that essence, Butterfield likened Slack as eventually becoming a utility, similar to the internet or electricity.""The world is going to continue to use more and more software and we deliberately try to put ourselves in a position where Slack the company gets more valuable as the world uses more software because Slack the product becomes more valuable for our customers as that customer uses more software,"" Butterfield said.Slack is the latest in a string of large technology companies coming to the public markets. But rather than a traditional IPO, the service will list its shares directly on the NYSE. It's the second major tech company over the last year to opt for a direct listing, following Spotify. Slack's ticker symbol will be SK.Slack, similar to the recent IPOs of Lyft and Pinterest, will offer two classes of shares, to consolidate voting power among its top shareholders. Slack's Class A common stock will receive one vote per share, while Class B will be entitled to 10 votes per share.Disclosure: Comcast Ventures, the venture arm of Comcast, is an investor in Slack. Comcast owns CNBC parent company NBCUniversal."
2019-05-14,Your Amazon Echo can now guard your home and listen for glass breaking. Here's how to set it up,0.14330051668761346,"Amazon on Tuesday began rolling out Alexa Guard to all Echo devices, including older models that didn't originally get the feature when it was launched late last year.Alexa Guard automatically listens for things like breaking glass and can alert you if it suspects someone is breaking into your home. If you have an ADT or Ring alarm system, it can also automatically set off the alarm. The feature was announced during Amazon's big Alexa event last September.Alexa Guard is free but still needs to be manually activated by you. It requires you to first speak ""Alexa, I'm leaving"" to activate Guard on your Echo and to force Alexa to begin listening for more than just the ""Alexa"" wake word.If an Echo hears a window break, it can send you an alert to your phone along with a live video feed if you have an Echo with a camera on it, like the Echo Show. An alert includes a 10-second audio recording of the glass breaking and anything else the Echo heard, but it otherwise doesn't listen unless you speak Alexa again.It will also send alerts if a smart smoke alarm or carbon monoxide alarm goes off. If you configure it, Guard can also automatically turn on smart lights at certain times while you're away, and it will automatically turn them on and off on a schedule as if you're home.""Alexa uses machine learning to determine the right lighting activity for your home based on lighting usage across customers,"" Amazon said.Amazon said it ""hired licensed contractors to break real glass in a testing lab,"" to help prevent false positives and to detect the actual sound of breaking glass. ""This team broke hundreds of different windows, in different sizes, including single pane and double pane, with a variety of instruments including crow bars, hammers, bricks, baseball bats, and more,"" the company explained in an email to CNBC.If you subscribe to ADT or use Amazon's Ring alarm system, Guard can automatically send alerts to professionals so that authorities arrive if a break-in is detected. If you don't have these systems, Alexa Guard won't call the police, it'll just notify you of a potential break-in.Here's how to set it up:Open the Alexa app on your phone.Tap the menu button on the top left.Choose ""Settings.""Choose ""Guard.""Tap ""Set up Guard.""Tap ""Add"" to detect smart smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors in your home.Tap ""Add"" to activate smart alerts for detecting the sound of broken glass.Choose ""Add"" again to activate smart lighting.Enter your zip code, so smart lighting knows when to turn on.Choose ""Confirm.""Now just speak ""Alexa, I'm leaving"" to activate Guard when you leave the house.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."

2019-06-04,US urges judge to deny Huawei motion in government effort to disqualify lawyer,0.01353305785123967,"U.S. prosecutors on Monday asked a judge to reject a motion by China's Huawei seeking information on the grounds for a government request to disqualify the company's lead defense lawyer in a criminal case alleging bank fraud and sanctions violations.    Last month, prosecutors argued Huawei lawyer James Cole's prior position as the No. 2 official in the U.S. Department of Justice created conflicts of interest that necessitated his removal.    The prosecutors said Cole, who served as deputy attorney general (DAG) until 2015, represented the government in a related investigation, without disclosing details. Huawei asked the court to review ""overbroad"" redactions in the U.S. motion seeking his removal.    Huawei wants prosecutors to reveal ""the very information it is trying to prevent the new client from learning,"" the prosecutors said in a letter to Judge Ann Donnelly in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York.   ""The conflict presented here is unprecedented,"" the prosecutors argued. The government was not aware of any other senior DOJ official who had sought to represent a client that had been part of his government work, ""let alone when the former representation involved classified information,"" they said.    A spokesman for Huawei Technologies, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, declined to comment, and Cole did not respond to a request for comment. Cole entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Huawei in March.    In a court filing two weeks ago, the Washington lawyer said that he had ""no recollection"" of what the government referenced as the basis for his disqualification in meetings.    In its letter Monday, prosecutors said what Cole remembers is irrelevant.    The Brooklyn case against Huawei was cited last month in a decision to add the company to a U.S. trade blacklist that makes it extremely difficult for the telecom giant to do business with U.S. companies.    Huawei has been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States, the order said.    The case and blacklisting have escalated tensions between Beijing and Washington amid a trade battle.   The indictment accuses Huawei and its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou of conspiring to defraud global banks by misrepresenting Huawei's relationship with a company that operated in Iran, putting the banks at risk of processing transactions that violated U.S. sanctions laws.   Meng, daughter of Huawei's founder, has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition from Canada to the United States."
2019-06-04,Trump officials say China pursuing 'blame game' on breakdown of trade talks,-0.05189342403628119,"U.S. President Donald Trump's administration said on Monday that China was pursuing a ""blame game"" in recent public statements and a weekend white paper that misrepresented the trade negotiations between the world's two largest economies.   In a joint statement, the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) office and the U.S. Treasury reiterated their view that China's negotiators had ""backpedaled"" on important elements of a deal that had been largely agreed, including on an enforcement provision.   ""Our insistence on detailed and enforceable commitments from the Chinese in no way constitutes a threat to Chinese sovereignty,"" USTR and the Treasury said. ""Rather, the issues discussed are common to trade agreements and are necessary to address the systemic issues that have contributed to persistent and unsustainable trade deficits.""   China on Sunday issued a government policy paper on the U.S.-China trade dispute in which it asserted that the United States bore responsibility for setbacks in the talks, citing three instances in which Washington had backtracked on commitments made during the negotiations.  China's Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen, a prominent member of Beijing's negotiating team, said in presenting the paper to the media that it would be impossible for the United States to use ""extreme pressure"" to force concessions from China.   Acrimonious rhetoric between Beijing and Washington has steadily increased since talks broke down in early May over U.S. accusations that Beijing had backtracked on commitments to codify in law changes to its intellectual property and technology transfer practices to address U.S. demands.   President Donald Trump imposed an increase in tariffs to 25% on a $200 billion list of Chinese goods on May 10, saying that China ""broke the deal."" His administration later imposed severe sanctions against Huawei Technologies Co, China's premier telecommunications equipment firm.  ""The United States is disappointed that the Chinese have chosen in the 'White Paper' issued (on Sunday) and recent public statements to pursue a blame game misrepresenting the nature and history of trade negotiations between the two countries,"" USTR and Treasury said in the statement.   The agencies, which have taken the lead in negotiations for the U.S. side, said that the impetus for the negotiations wasChina's ""long history of unfair trade practices,"" and U.S. negotiating positions have been consistent throughout the talks.   There have been no talks scheduled since the last round ended in May, and it remains unclear whether Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet when they both attend the G20 leaders summit later this month in Japan."
2019-06-09,Raytheon and United Technologies agree to all-stock merger that would create aerospace behemoth,0.07695247933884297,"Raytheon and United Technologies on Sunday announced they would merge in an all-stock deal, a tie-up that would create a behemoth in the fast-growing defense and aerospace sectors.The combination would bring together United Technologies booming aerospace business that makes everything from jet engines, cockpit controls and airplane seats with Tomahawk missile maker Raytheon.The companies would have combined annual sales of around $74 billion, the companies said. That would make the new company, which they are planning to call Raytheon Technologies, the second-largest aerospace and defense company in the U.S. by revenue, behind Boeing.""The combination of United Technologies and Raytheon will define the future of aerospace and defense,"" United Technologies chairman and CEO Greg Hayes said in a release. ""By joining forces, we will have unsurpassed technology and expanded R&D capabilities that will allow us to invest through business cycles and address our customers' highest priorities.""United Technologies has reaped the benefits from searing global aircraft demand and has been beefing up its commercial aerospace business, which includes jet engine maker Pratt and Whitney. In November 2018, it closed its acquisition of Rockwell Collins.The two companies have little overlap and may not face strong regulatory push-back to their deal, said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at Teal Group.The new company would be headquartered in the Boston area, the two firms said in the release. Raytheon is based in Waltham, Mass., a Boston suburb.If completed, shareholders in Farmington, Conn.-based United Technologies would own 57% of the new company while Raytheon's would own 43% on a diluted basis.The deal, which the two companies called a ""merger of equals,"" is expected to close in the first half of 2020, they said.Like other industrial conglomerates, United Technologies shedding businesses to focus on highly profitable units. It is the middle of spinning its Otis elevator business and its Carrier air conditioning unit into separate companies. The merger with Raytheon wouldn't affect that process and it is still on track to close in the first half of 2020, the companies said Sunday.United Technologies' chief executive Hayes would become CEO of the combined company, and Raytheon's CEO Thomas Kennedy would become chairman. Two years after the deal closes Hayes would become chairman.Raytheon and United Technologies have a combined market value of nearly $166 billion. Raytheon shareholders will get 2.3348 shares in the new company for each Raytheon share, the firms said."

The Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.1% to 8,091.16 and posted a four-day winning streak.Chipmaker shares rose broadly. Skyworks Solutions gained 6% while Micron Technology advanced 3.9%. Shares of Qualcomm and Broadcom climbed 1.9% and 4.3%, respectively. Tech giant Apple also rose 1.8%.""The markets appear to be content with the cooperative tone coming out of the meetings. To me, it felt like the contrarian play was to the upside post meetings,"" said Dan Deming, managing director at KKM Financial. ""There was a great deal of bearishness in sentiment headed into the meeting. Many market observers were discounting any change in the narrative, which made many believe the risk was to the downside.""At its session high, the S&P 500 was up 1.2%. The Dow and Nasdaq rose as much as 290 points and 1.8% respectively.The major indexes started paring their gains around midday in New York. If it weren't for the big gains from chipmakers and other technology stocks on the Huawei reprieve, it would likely be an average slightly higher market day in reaction to the trade truce.""There was a fair amount of exuberance at the open. I don't know if it was celebrating good news or the absence of bad news,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. ""Either way, we started strong. The problem is, while we had a new high on the S&P 500, the number of individual stocks making new highs was shy of what we say back in late June,"" when the index made its latest record close.""I don't want to overstress the importance of it, but it is not confirming the index-level highs,"" Delwiche said.Monday's gains got Wall Street starting off the second half of the year on the right foot following a big first half. The S&P 500 rallied more than 17% to start off 2019, notching its best first half in more than 20 years.That surge came after stocks recovered in June from a torrid May performance. The Dow soared 7.2% in June, its biggest gain for that month since 1938. The S&P 500, meanwhile, jumped 7.9% for the month, marking its best June performance since 1955.President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed not to impose new levies on U.S. and Chinese goods after meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan on Saturday.Trump said the meeting went as well as it could have, noting: ""We are right back on track."" Chinese state-run news outlet Xinhua said the two leaders agreed to ""to restart trade consultations between their countries on the basis of equality and mutual respect.""Trump added the U.S. will ease restrictions on American companies from selling products to Huawei, a giant telecommunications company from China. The U.S. barred companies from selling to Huawei in May, citing national security concerns. The U.S. president also said China would ""buy farm product.""Investors anxiously awaited the meeting between Trump and Xi as they looked for clues on whether the world's largest economies would resume trade negotiations or if the conflict would be prolonged.Chetan Ahya, global head of economics at Morgan Stanley, described the meeting's outcome as ""an uncertain pause.""There is ""no immediate escalation, but still no clear path towards a comprehensive deal,"" Ahya said in a note Sunday. ""As things stand, we lack clarity on whether real progress was achieved on the sticking points that caused talks to break down in the first place. Hence, our overarching conclusion is that the developments over the weekend on their own don't do enough to remove the uncertainty created by trade tensions.""Comments from Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, added to the uncertainty around U.S.-China trade relations. Kudlow told Fox News on Sunday that Trump was not granting Huawei ""general amnesty."" He also said there is no timetable for when a deal might be finalized.The lingering uncertainty around U.S.-China trade relations will continue to dampen the outlook on corporate earnings, said Larry McDonald, editor of The Bear Traps Report.""There's a substantial decay factor developing inside the S&P 500's earnings picture,"" McDonald said. ""CFO's cannot make decisions with a purgatory of uncertainty, endlessly ... hanging over the market. The equity rally is a screaming sell.""Calendar second-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to fall on a year-over-year basis, according to FactSet data. Analysts also lowered their third-quarter earnings forecast to show a contraction from the previous year, as profit expectations for multinationals with exposure to China have soured.China and the U.S. have been embroiled in a trade war for more than a year.

2019-07-28,"Fewer investors have a 'fear of missing out,' so it may be time to buckle up, market bull suggests",0.1425078369905956,"Oppenheimer Asset Management's John Stoltzfus suggests investors may want to fasten their seat belts.The long-time bull expects a wave of near-term volatility to pressure stocks. He's blaming uncertainty surrounding this week's Federal Reserve decision on interest rates, another big batch of second quarter earnings results and a fresh round of U.S.-China trade talks.""Any kind of disappointment in a sense, okay, I can kind of take profits today without FOMO [fear of missing out] gripping my soul,"" the firm's chief investment strategist told CNBC's ""Futures Now"" last Thursday.With the fear of missing out gripping fewer investors, Stoltzfus contends it's not the time to get aggressive.""We're highly selective at this point with the S&P 500 up over 20%,"" he said.The index, which closed the week at new record highs, has already surpassed Stoltzfus' year-end target of 2,860 by almost 6%. He's planning to tweak the number once there's more visibility.""It's under revision at this time. We're going to wait until after the Fed makes its decision on the 31st,"" he said ""At that point, we'll put in our new target for the year-end, depending on how that goes.""Stoltzfus notes a more favorable development in the U.S.-China trade war would be an integral part of his bull case. He believes it's the biggest headwind holding back stocks from ripping even higher.""It would be confirmation that indeed the markets thought things weren't so bad, were actually pretty good,"" he said.For now, Stoltzfus is bracing for a 3 to 4% pullback to strike stocks near term. He'd look to add cyclical names such as consumer discretionary, industrials, financials and technology on weakness.""Tech looks like a great place to be because technology flows into all of the eleven sectors.

Negotiations are set to resume in September in Washington.Tensions between the White House and Chinese technology giants may also be contributing to the global economic slowdown, Lipton said.""It's time for the countries to have dialogue, to reach agreements, to try to find a way through this, since the global economy is fragile,"" he said.Global trade has been lower in the first six months of this year compared with the same period in 2018, Lipton said, adding that it's a ""time for vigilance.""""Global trade is actually contracting, and that is not a good situation,"" he warned.Lipton said that if a global recession were to start, central banks, including the Federal Reserve, would be in weakened positions to fight it because of all the easy monetary policies.Case in point, the Fed lowered interest rates by 0.25% on Wednesday.Lipton moved into the acting director role after Christine Lagarde resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund.

2019-08-06,Amazon's PillPack is battling with CVS and Walgreens over getting patient prescriptions,0.1151475068141735,"As Amazon bolsters its PillPack business to take on the prescription drug market, industry stalwarts CVS and Walgreens are vigorously defending their turf, setting up a protracted battle between the old guard and the new.Amazon bought internet pharmacy PillPack last year, a deal that sent shares of pharmacy companies tumbling. To get people onto its mail-delivery service, PillPack needs patients to switch from their existing pharmacy, which often means transferring prescriptions from CVS or Walgreens, the two largest chains in the U.S.But PillPack has run into a significant roadblock in getting those transfers approved. CVS and Walgreens are rejecting an increasing number of their requests, claiming that PillPack isn't getting proper consent from patients. PillPack says it always gets patient approval before making transfer requests and blames the pharmacy giants for unfairly refusing to honor them, sometimes hanging up on PillPack's pharmacists or throwing the request forms in the trash.""While incumbent pharmacies may be disappointed in the loss of business, it is unacceptable to make unsubstantiated allegations about PillPack's practices while simultaneously creating systemic barriers that make it harder for a customer to switch pharmacies,"" PillPack spokeswoman Jacquelyn Miller told CNBC.The conflict has continued to escalate, with a source familiar with the matter telling CNBC that Amazon is documenting all cases of refused transfers. The incumbents are unwilling to roll over for Amazon in a market where a single customer, who often has chronic conditions and requires regular refills, can represent thousands of dollars of revenue a year through copayments and insurance coverage.PillPack, a licensed pharmacy service in 49 of 50 states, launched in 2014 with a service that neatly packages, labels and delivers medications every month with free shipping. CVS has followed with its own multi-dose packaging option for patients who need help taking multiple medications. Walgreens also has a home delivery program.The intensifying spat over transfers offers a window into the larger challenge Amazon faces as it tries to mimic its e-commerce playbook in the prescription medication world, where spending in the U.S. is approaching $500 billion a year. The company is already battling Surescripts, an e-prescribing network part-owned by CVS and Express Scripts, over a patient data dispute. Last month, Surescripts threatened to cut off a contract with a third party called ReMy Health, which gave PillPack access to data about patient prescription histories, and said it would turn the case over to the FBI.CVS says it's not indiscriminately rejecting transfer orders, but rather is calling patients when a request is submitted to make sure the customer has asked for it. Many of these patients are older and unfamiliar with the new world of online shopping and mobile apps.The pharmacies say they're only denying transfers when patients tell them they never signed up for PillPack or have never even heard of it. The issue can be particularly challenging for people with dementia who may not have intended to sign up or not remembered doing so. Brian Caswell, the owner of Wolkar Drug in Kansas, said he's called patients about PillPack requests only to have them deny ever providing consent.""Could they have clicked on something online and forgot about it?"" Caswell said. ""It's possible.""There could also be patients who did request a transfer to PillPack but are embarrassed to admit it when their pharmacist calls for confirmation.The fight with the big pharmacies began almost immediately after Amazon announced the PillPack acquisition in June 2018, for $753 million (though the price wasn't disclosed until later). A month after the deal, CVS sent a cease-and-desist letter to PillPack's lawyers, and Walgreens sent a strongly-worded warning in August, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not be named because the letters were confidential.Both CVS and Walgreens confirmed that they reached out to PillPack but didn't specify the exact nature of the correspondence.""We've communicated our concerns directly to PillPack,"" a Walgreens spokesperson said. ""We respect our patients' privacy rights, and strongly believe that patients are entitled to, and benefit from a personal and trusted relationship with their pharmacist.""A CVS spokesperson said that while it's ""common practice"" for pharmacists to legitimately request prescription transfers from its pharmacies, the company ""notified PillPack to stop any activity to initiate prescription transfers without the informed consent of our pharmacy patients.""PillPack responded at the time to both CVS and Walgreens, denying that the company was doing anything wrong.Here's how a transfer works. A CVS or Walgreens customer sees a PillPack ad on television or online and pulls up the PillPack website or calls a company representative. By phone, PillPack says, patients are asked explicitly if they give the company consent to transfer prescriptions from their current pharmacy. From the website, the patient fills out personal information, includes relevant prescriptions and then clicks a blue button to complete the signup.Just below the blue button, here's what the fine print says:""By clicking the 'Finish Signing Up' button above, you consent to PillPack transferring your prescriptions from your existing pharmacies to PillPack and/or contacting your doctors to request new prescription and refills.""From there, a PillPack representative calls or faxes the existing pharmacy and requests the transfer. It's a straightforward process that happens all the time when patients move or when they're traveling and need to pick up a refill before returning home. In the U.S., there are federal and state laws that, with some exceptions, require pharmacists to transfer prescription information to another pharmacy.However, PillPack said its pharmacists began reporting challenges with patient transfer requests in the weeks after the acquisition was announced. Additionally, the company said it heard reports in July 2018, that CVS hosted a training session for pharmacists, informing them that they should not transfer to PillPack until after they notified patients about the company's rival service.CVS told CNBC that, starting last year, it recommended its pharmacists check in with customers following a PillPack transfer request after hearing a series of complaints about the company's practices. CVS also said representatives tell customers about the company's own mail-order service but that its pharmacies will facilitate a transfer to PillPack if the patient still wants it.CVS and Walgreens aren't the only pharmacies concerned about PillPack's actions. Douglas Hoey, chief executive officer of the National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents U.S. pharmacy owners and is one of the owners of Surescripts, said his team has heard from 20 to 30 pharmacists who said they were concerned after patients told them they never authorized transfers to PillPack. Pharmacists have also been vocal on internet forum Reddit, where in several threads some have admitted that they automatically throw PillPack faxes ""in the shred bin,"" or call patients to get confirmation.Update: This story was updated to say that the National Community Pharmacists Association is a part owner of Surescripts.WATCH: How Amazon could change the pharmacy businessFollow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech industry news."

Healthcare stocks bucked the trend, hovering just above the flatline.Italy's coalition government imploded on Thursday, as deputy prime minister and leader of Italy's ruling Lega party, Matteo Salvini, declared the arrangement unworkable and called for fresh general elections.Italy's FTSE MIB index was 2.5% lower by the end of Friday's session, as investors veered away from Italian assets amid the rising instability.Italian bank stocks plunged, with Banco BPM shares tumbling 9%, while Unicredit and Ubi Banca fell by 5% and 8% respectively.In the latest trade war developments, a majority of economists polled by Reuters said the recent escalation of tensions between the U.S. and China had brought forward the next U.S. recession, and indicated that the Federal Reserve is likely to cut rates again in September before a further cut next year.Meanwhile, a Bloomberg report claimed Thursday that the U.S. is holding off on giving permission to U.S. companies to use Huawei products after China halted its buying of American agricultural produce.Later, President Trump said the U.S. was not ready to do business with Huawei and he was not ready to do a trade deal with China.China's currency remains in focus as the People's Bank of China (PBOC) again set the daily yuan midpoint weaker than the key barometer of 7 per dollar.Stocks on Wall Street extended losses during Friday's trading session, dragged down by chip stocks which fell on the back of Trump's latest statement on China.Back in Europe, official data showed that the British economy has shrunk for the first time since late 2012 after U.K. second quarter GDP (gross domestic product) contracted by 0.2%.Sterling and the FTSE 100 were both trading lower on the news, with uncertainty increasing as British media speculated that a general election may be called in the U.K. by November.Looking at individual stocks, London-listed WPP surged to the top of the Stoxx 600 after its earnings beat forecasts, with shares up more than 7%.At the other end of the European benchmark were Italian lenders Ubi Banca and Banco BPM."

2019-08-22,Kraft is taking the CFTC to court keep the lid on a $16 million fine in market manipulation case,0.10185157220040943,"Kraft and Mondelez are taking the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to court in a bid to keep the agency from discussing a $16 million fine to settle allegations of manipulating the wheat markets.The two food companies agreed to pay the fine as part of a deal with the CFTC that the companies say restricted what regulators could say about the case. Kraft and Mondelez, which was created when Kraft split into two companies in 2012, are now suing the CFTC for contempt. They filed a motion in federal court in Chicago on Friday, saying the regulator violated the order in an Aug. 15 press release announcing the deal.""The CFTC and its Commissioners engaged in a deliberate, orchestrated effort to violate the Court's Consent Order within minutes of its entry,"" the companies said in the filing. The two sides face off in court Sept. 12, according to court documents.According to the CFTC, Kraft intentionally drove down the price of wheat in 2011 by buying an excessive amount of futures contracts on the grain.Food companies have made such moves to hedge fluctuations in commodities prices by agreeing to pay a specific price at a specific date in the future. Unlike a hedge fund or trading firm, companies like Kraft are limited in their futures purchases and are prohibited from speculating.Kraft was allowed to have a futures position of roughly 3 million bushels of wheat, the CFTC said in the original complaint. Instead, Kraft allegedly bought futures contracts for 15.75 million bushels, worth more than $93 million.The consent order included a clause that read ""neither party shall make any public statement about this case other than to refer to the terms of this settlement agreement or public documents filed in this case.""The order also prohibited the CFTC from saying whether either defendant violated federal law.After the agreement, the CFTC issued a press release on Aug. 15 saying the penalty was ""valued at three times the alleged gain"" and included statements from Chairman Heath P. Tarbert and links to statements from individual commissioners.""Market manipulation inflicts real pain on farmers by denying them the fair value of their hard work and crops,"" Tarbert said in his statement. ""It also hurts American families by raising the costs of putting food on the table. Instances of market manipulation are precisely the kinds of cases the CFTC was founded to pursue.""The CFTC told the court Saturday that its public statements didn't violate the order and that its individual commissioners were not bound by the agreement. The CFTC voluntarily removed the announcement from its website until the next court appearance.The CFTC and Kraft declined to comment for this article. Mondelez did not respond to a request for comment.The segments of Kraft and Mondelez named as defendants in the case were part of the same company in 2011 when the trades took place. In 2012, Kraft Foods changed its name to Mondelez and spun off Kraft Foods Group Inc., which merged with Heinz in 2015 to form the Kraft Heinz Co.Kraft's futures position in 2011 represented 87% of the active futures market for that particular month and type of wheat, according to the CFTC. The agency accused the company of taking this position to try to lower the price of wheat in the spot market where it was buying the grain.With Kraft signaling to the market that it intended to change its normal plan and buy wheat through the futures market instead of the spot market, the price of wheat in the futures market rose and the cash price fell, allowing Kraft to reap a profit, according to the complaint.When the company bought wheat in the spot market and unwound a large portion of its futures position, it generated a gain of more than $5 million, according to the CFTC.Some companies are allowed to file for exemptions to the caps on futures positions for hedging purposes. The CFTC said Kraft did not have an exemption and that its futures position represented a six-month supply of the wheat it needed at its Toledo area-flour mill and was not for legitimate business purposes.The regulator also said Kraft performed illegal offsetting trades of futures contracts with itself.Kraft has been one of the worst-performing large cap stocks in 2019, shedding more than 40% of its share price this year. The stock of Mondelez International, the parent company of the defendant in this suit, is up more than 35% this year.Clarification: The headline of this article was changed to clarify that Kraft hasn't filed a new lawsuit against the CFTC. The company filed a contempt motion in an already existing lawsuit by the agency."
2019-08-25,Disney is putting dozens of stores inside Target locations while Target set to open at Walt Disney World Resort,0.19400511609602517,"Target on Sunday announced it's opening dozens of permanent Disney stores within its own stores over the next year, as it invests in more unique ways to lure customers inside.The announcement comes on the heels of Target's strong quarterly earnings report last week, where it showed it drove more people to stores and got them to spend more money there. Its stock touched a record intraday high of $106.52 on Thursday. Target shares are now up more than 55% year to date.This Oct. 4, ahead of the holiday season, 25 Disney stores will open at certain Target stores across the country, in cities including Philadelphia, Denver and Chicago. (See a full list of those locations below.) Forty additional Disney locations — selling toys, games, apparel and more — are planned to open by October 2020, the big-box retailer said. It will also be launching a Disney-themed experience on its website, beginning Sunday, where shoppers can find products from the Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars brands, among others.In expanding its tie-up with Disney, Target will also be opening a small-format store right near the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, in 2021, the companies said.""Disney is among our largest and most admired [brand] relationships,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell said on a call with members of the media. ""We have spent a lot of time thinking about how to grow.""Cornell declined to comment on how much Disney merchandise currently brings Target in terms of sales, or how much of a revenue driver he expects the Disney store expansion to be.Meanwhile, the announcement comes as retailers across the U.S., including Target, Walmart, Kohl's and Amazon, are still vying for the market share Toys R Us left up for grabs after it liquidated last year. Though, the Toys R Us brand is still mapping out a comeback of its own.Ahead of last holiday season, Target added a quarter-million square feet of space permanently dedicated to toys across more than 500 stores. About 100 stores received a fuller remodel in the toy aisles. When it reported 2018 holiday results, Target said same-store sales were up 5.7%, with the toy category being one of its strongest.Disney said it will be opening the first batch of stores at Target right as a new assortment of merchandise from Disney's ""Frozen 2"" and ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" hits shelves. It said it will also sell some collectible merchandise there, like dolls and apparel from its Disney Animators' Collection.The companies explained the Disney stores within Target will be staffed by Target employees, who are set to receive special training ahead of the openings.The mini Disney stores will span about 750 square feet on average, they said, and will be located next to kids clothing and the existing toy aisles in Target stores. Each store is expected to hold more than 450 items, including about 100 products that could previously only be found at Disney retail locations. It has more than 300 such stores globally today.Target said many items will be under $20, with most ranging from $2 to $200. There will also be seating areas in the pint-sized shops for families to sit, listen to Disney music and watch Disney movie clips or take photos in front of interactive displays, it said.People who own Disney gear or visit Disney theme parks are likely people who also shop at Target, according to Bob Chapek, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. He said there's about a 90% overlap between the two company's customers.""This gives us the opportunity to expand our footprint well beyond [malls],"" Chapek said on a call with members of the media. ""The experiential retail coming to Target is just what today's consumer is looking for.""Chapek said Disney also has a partnership with J.C. Penney in some department stores, which it will continue even as it works with Target. ""That was something we started at smaller scale than what this was going to be,"" he said about teaming up with Penney.The announcement for Disney also comes as it's been revealing new information about its upcoming streaming service's shows and films during its Disney+ panel at D23 Expo this weekend in Anaheim, California.Meanwhile, for Target, an expanded partnership with Disney could become just one of many national brand partnerships growing in its stores, hundreds of which are being remodeled. CVS acquired Target's pharmacy business back in 2015, for example, and now operates that part of Target's stores through a ""store-within-a-store"" format. Target also recently announced it will be bringing denim maker Levi's to dozens of stores.""Based on the performance of our business, we've had interest from a number of different vendors,"" Cornell said. But he cautioned Target will be very ""selective"" in picking the brands it chooses to work with. ""I can't think about a better national brand partner than Disney.""Here are the 25 Target locations where Disney is set to open on Oct. 4:Allen North #2516 (Allen, Texas)Austin NW #1797 (Austin, Texas)Bozeman #1237 (Bozeman, Mont.)Brighton #922 (Brighton, Mich.)Chicago Brickyard #1924 (Chicago, Ill.)Clearwater #1820 (Clearwater, Fla.)Denver Stapleton #2052 (Denver, Colo.)Edmond #1398 (Edmond, Okla.)Euless #1368 (Euless, Texas)Houston North Central #1458 (Spring, Texas)Jacksonville Mandarin #1300 (Jacksonville, Fla.)Keizer #2110 (Keizer, Ore.)Lake Stevens #1331 (Lake Stevens, Wash.)Leesburg #1874 (Leesburg, Va.)Loveland #1178 (Loveland, Colo.)Maple Grove North #2193 (Maple Grove, Minn.)Mobile West #1376 (Mobile, Ala.)Murrieta #1283 (Murrieta, Calif.)New Lenox #2028 (New Lenox, Ill.)Pasadena #1396 (Pasadena, Texas)Philadelphia West #2124 (Philadelphia, Pa.)San Jose College Park #2088 (San Jose, Calif.)South Jordan #2123 (South Jordan, Utah)Stroudsburg #1260 (Stroudsburg, Pa.)Waterford Park #2068 (Clarksville, Ind.)"
2019-09-09,"Review: Google Nest Hub's new smart display can read your face, but some may find that too creepy",0.1595968824457196,"Google's Nest Hub Max, a larger version of the Nest Hub that was announced during Google I/O in June, is now available for purchase. I've been using it for the past several days, so I wanted to let you know what it's like.It's similar to the Nest Hub, which launched last year and serves as a smart display that lets you watch YouTube TV ($50 a month), stream music and speak to Google Assistant. It also helps you learn more about your day, with information on your commute to work, reminders and more.The Nest Hub Max represents yet another way Google is getting into our homes, and this time with a camera. It's similar to the Facebook Portal+, but it has a smaller display and can do a lot more. It's also Google's answer to Amazon's line of Echo Show products, which range in size, price and capability.While the $129 Nest Hub is best served in places like the bedroom, given its small 7-inch screen, Google wants the $229 Nest Hub Max and its larger 10-inch screen to take over your kitchen or living room. It has a camera for video chats with family or for monitoring your house while you're away. That camera can also recognize each member of your family's face, so it can display unique information for each person it sees.Here's what you need to know.I like the big screen on the Nest Hub Max, since I was able to watch a football game in the kitchen and still see the score. The bigger screen makes it easier to see menus, too, if you use the Hub Max for recipes (I'm a terrible cook, so I didn't try this) and for viewing photos.That's one of the best parts of the Hub and Hub Max: It serves as a great digital photo frame for displaying any albums you want from Google Photos. My wife and I love seeing old memories pop up on the regular Hub when we walk into the kitchen, and now they're even bigger.There's a built-in wide-angle camera that lets other people easily see you during a Google Duo video call. It follows you around the room, too, so you can walk and talk at the same time, much like the video chat feature on the Facebook Portal.You can call people who have Duo installed on either an iPhone or an Android phone, and it's free. One problem, though. I tried calling someone on Duo who was using a phone rather than another Nest Hub Max, and the video on my end wasn't good, even with the big display.They were able to see me and my entire kitchen, though, which means they benefited from my better camera. I think video chats would be most appealing between two Nest Hub Max owners, so I want to get a couple for my family over the holidays.The camera can be added to your Nest account to double as a security device when you're away. I set it so it turned off when I was home, but it automatically switched on when I was away to let me check in on the kitchen from my smartphone. You can get alerts if someone walks into the room, and it synced well with my existing in-home and outdoor Nest cameras. If you're worried about the camera, you can turn it off. There's a switch on the back of the Hub Max to turn the camera and the microphones off. Google says it's a hardware switch, so, in theory, someone can't hack in and turn it back on.Google Assistant is built in, so you can ask it to play music on Spotify, launch YouTube videos, play TV channels from YouTube TV, check the weather, call people and more. It understood me really well, even when I was across the room. And when you're blaring music, you can pause it by simply holding your hand in the air, or resume it doing the same gesture. This also works for timers, if you don't want to talk to Google but have a bunch of cake batter on your hands.One of the most unique features is also a bit worrying, though.The Nest Hub Max's camera can be used to recognize anyone who walks in the room. One morning, it showed me how long it was going to take me to get to work, recommended YouTube videos and Google News catered to me. It could do the same for my wife, switching up all of that information when it recognized her face.Except my wife won't register her face. Even though Google says it keeps your facial recognition data locked down to the device and doesn't use it for anything else, I'm a bit skeptical. For one, you need to register your face on a phone, so it has to travel to Google's servers first before it lands on the Hub Max. My wife told me she thinks it's ""creepy."" Maybe your family will feel differently, but Google hasn't gained everyone's trust yet.The speakers sound just OK. For $229, I expected something better, but they get irritating at high volumes. They're fine for just playing casual music in the kitchen, but you won't want to replace your Sonos speakers for this. That's kind of annoying, since I now have to keep a Sonos speaker in the kitchen in addition to a smart display, just to make sure I have good music in the room everyone hangs out in.I like it a lot. The Nest Hub Max is a big screen for viewing photos, recipes, TV shows, your schedule and more, all wherever you decide to plug it in. It works well at what Google says it can do: The cameras are solid, it connects to Nest just fine, it's good at recognizing my face (even if it's creepy to my wife) and it's priced well for what you get. I like the information more than what the Echo Show can provide, but you should stick with that if you're already an Echo household. If that appeals to you, then yes it's a good buy.If you're not wild about the $229 price and don't care about the camera features, then give the regular Nest Hub a try. It has a smaller 7-inch screen, costs $129 and is often on sale for about $99 but does most of the same things that the Hub Max can do.Follow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech product news."
2019-09-19,Light Street's Glen Kacher says there's profitability in sight for Uber and Lyft despite falling stocks,0.09364478114478116,"NEW YORK — Newly public ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft have tumbled more than 25% since their initial public offerings, but Light Street's Glen Kacher still believes there's a path for profitability for them.""The end market is huge,"" Kacher, chief investment officer and founder of Light Street Capital, said at the Delivering Alpha conference presented by CNBC and Institutional Investor.Kacher said Uber and Lyft are both raising prices rapidly in the U.S. and they are also benefiting from rise in the food delivering business. Kacher, who manages $2 billion in global technology assets, said he's a shareholder in both companies.It hasn't been smooth sailing for those two ride-sharing companies, however. Uber went public in May, and reported a $1.8 billion loss ahead of its public debut. It revealed a $5.2 billion loss in the second quarter. Uber's ride-hailing rival Lyft, posted a 2018 loss of $900 million ahead of its March IPO. Both stocks are down more than 25% since their IPO date.""Investors and maybe the financial press are quite negative"" on both companies, Kacher said.Scott Kupor, Andreessen Horowitz's managing partner, is less bullish on them as their cash-consuming business is less likely to bode well in a late-cycle environment.Kupor said he sees big opportunities in enterprise software companies.""I think the market size for those [software] companies is just materially bigger than we had expected,"" Kupor said. He highlighted cloud-based software company Salesforce whose stock has gone up 12% this year."
2019-09-26,Huawei CEO says it's working on 6G — but the technology is still some 10 years off,0.05457963089542037,"Huawei has begun research on 6G — the successor to 5G mobile networks which are not yet widespread, according to its CEO Ren Zhengfei.5G is the name of next-generation mobile networks that promises super-fast data speeds and the ability to underpin new technologies like driverless cars. These networks are slowly rolling out in places such as South Korea, the U.K. and soon China. However, they are not yet available on a large scale.However, Huawei's founder Ren is already talking about 6G.""We have parallel work being done on 5G and 6G, so we started out 6G a long time ago,"" Ren said during a CNBC-hosted panel on Thursday. He said it's in an ""early phase"" and there's still ""a long way to go"" before commercialization, according to an official translation of his Mandarin comments.Ren said the technology is still ""ten years out.""A number of things need to take place before 6G becomes a reality.For any new mobile network generation, standards need to be set by the industry. This has taken place for 5G and initial discussions have happened regarding 6G, but standards could take years to form.Another issue is that it's still not clear what 6G will be needed for.Huawei is currently focusing its efforts on 5G, however. The company has signed over 50 commercial 5G contracts, more than its closest competitors Nokia and Ericsson.The Chinese tech giant is facing continued pressure on the U.S. which has accused it of being a national security risk, saying that it could build backdoors into its networking equipment to allow the Chinese government to spy on Americans. Huawei has repeatedly denied those allegations."
2019-10-09,Saudi Aramco says full oil production capacity will return by end of November,0.0016762452107279779,"DUBAI ⁠— Saudi Arabia's full oil production capacity will be recovered by the end of November, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told CNBC on Wednesday.""By September we will be, in terms of production capacity, at 11.3 (million barrels per day), by end of November we will be at 12 million barrels per day (bdp), which is our maximum sustained capacity,"" Nasser told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick during the Oil & Money Conference in London. Saudi Arabia is the world's largest exporter of oil.The OPEC kingpin has been pumping significantly below that 12 million bpd level as part of a coordinated agreement OPEC and non-OPEC producers to lower output and keep a floor under falling oil prices.Aramco's revenues were not reduced in the wake of the attacks, Nasser noted, and put its October production figure at 9.9 million bpd.The CEO of the world's largest oil company expressed his concern over an ""absence of international resolve"" against the perpetrators of September 14 drone and missile attacks on Aramco facilities that forced the company to shut down half of its production and sent crude prices up nearly 20%.""An absence of international resolve to take concrete action may embolden the attackers and indeed put the world's energy security at greater risk,"" Nasser said.The attacks had ""no impact"" on the planned public listing of the state oil giant, the CEO added, saying that if anything, they strengthened the company's position with regard to the offering. The Saudi Aramco initial public offering (IPO), which has seen multiple delays since it was first suggested in 2016, would be the world's largest.""We are ready whenever the shareholders decide it is the time to list,"" Nasser said.Aramco is expected to file its IPO prospectus by the end of this month, according to reports.The kingdom reportedly plans to list 1% of Aramco on its local stock exchange, the Tadawul, before the end of this year and another 1% in 2020 as first steps ahead of a public sale of roughly 5% of the company. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has estimated the firm's value at $2 trillion, while analysts put the figure closer to $1.5 trillion.The success of the IPO depends in part on the oil price, which is down some 30% in the last year, despite heightened geopolitical tensions in the Gulf region.Brent crude futures were trading at $58.78 a barrel on Wednesday morning at 11:15 a.m. London time, up nearly 1% from the previous day. Still, the international oil benchmark's price is now lower than it was the day before the Aramco attacks, which Riyadh and Washington have blamed on Iran, a charge Tehran denies.There are ""many factors"" impacting the oil price today, Nasser told CNBC's Sedgwick, noting that the global economic situation as a whole was affecting crude prices. ""I think market was very satisfied with Saudi Aramco's response (to the attacks), but also... there is a tariffs dispute ongoing between two super global economies. All of these things are impacting price of crude.""The CEO added that there is ample oil supply on the market, and that he expects demand to average at 1 million bpd.In earlier comments Wednesday, Nasser said that there was ""no doubt"" Iran was behind attacks on Saudi Arabia, which struck multiple points at two of Aramco's largest facilities: Abqaiq, the largest crude oil processing and stabilization plant in the world, and Khurais, the kingdom's second-largest oil field.Yemen's Houthi rebels, who have been at war with the Saudis since 2015 and are backed by Iran, claimed responsibility for the strike, but numerous Western governments and security experts say the rebels could not have carried out such a sophisticated attack.In late September, ratings agency Fitch downgraded Saudi Arabia's long-term foreign currency issuer default rating from A+ to A, citing the ""vulnerability of its economic infrastructure"" and ""deterioration in Saudi Arabia's fiscal and external balance sheets."" Riyadh was quick to reject the downgrade, calling it ""somewhat speculative.""The Aramco IPO is part of the kingdom's Vision 2030, an initiative spearheaded by the 34-year-old crown prince to diversify the country's economy and reduce its reliance on hydrocarbon revenues."
2019-10-15,"Trump lawyer Giuliani was paid $500,000 to consult on indicted associate's firm",0.014454545454545453,"President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was paid $500,000 for work he did for a company co-founded by the Ukrainian-American businessman arrested last week on campaign finance charges, Giuliani told Reuters on Monday.The businessman, Lev Parnas, is a close associate of Giuliani and was involved in his effort to investigate Trump's political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic Party nomination.Giuliani said Parnas' company, Boca Raton, Florida-based Fraud Guarantee, whose website says it aims to help clients ""reduce and mitigate fraud,"" engaged Giuliani Partners, a management and security consulting firm, around August 2018. Giuliani said he was hired to consult on Fraud Guarantee's technologies and provide legal advice on regulatory issues.Federal prosecutors are ""examining Giuliani's interactions"" with Parnas and another Giuliani associate, Igor Fruman, who was also indicted on campaign finance charges, a law enforcement source told Reuters on Sunday.The New York Times reported last week that Parnas had told associates he paid Giuliani hundreds of thousands of dollars for what Giuliani said was business and legal advice. Giuliani said for the first time on Monday that the total amount was $500,000.Giuliani told Reuters the money came in two payments made within weeks of each other. He said he could not recall the dates of the payments. He said most of the work he did for Fraud Guarantee was completed in 2018 but that he had been doing follow-up for over a year.Parnas and Fruman were arrested at Dulles Airport outside Washington last week on charges they funneled foreign money to unnamed U.S. politicians in a bid to influence U.S.-Ukraine relations in violation of U.S. campaign finance laws. The men were preparing to board a plane to Europe.According to an indictment unsealed by U.S. prosecutors, an unidentified Russian businessman arranged for two $500,000 wires to be sent from foreign bank accounts to a U.S. account controlled by Fruman in September and October 2018. The money was used, in part, by Fruman, Parnas and two other men charged in the indictment to gain influence with U.S. politicians and candidates, the indictment said.Foreign nationals are prohibited from making contributions and other expenditures in connection with U.S. elections, and from making contributions in someone else's name.Giuliani said he was confident that the money he received was from ""a domestic source,"" but he would not say where it came from.""I know beyond any doubt the source of the money is not any questionable source,"" he told Reuters in an interview. ""The money did not come from foreigners. I can rule that out 100%,"" he said.He declined to say whether the money had been paid directly to him by Fraud Guarantee or from another source.John Dowd, a lawyer for Parnas and Fruman, also would not discuss the source of the funding that Giuliani said he received for his work for Fraud Guarantee. ""What I know is privileged,"" Dowd said."
2019-10-24,"Amazon announces three new renewable energy projects, including its first in Scotland",0.07850729517396184,"Amazon announced three renewable energy projects on Thursday, saying it was committed to minimizing carbon emissions following criticism earlier this year.The tech giant said the facilities would provide energy to its Amazon Web Services data centers. A wind farm, with a max capacity of 50 megawatts (MW), will be situated on Scotland's Kintyre Peninsula and is expected to produce 168,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of energy each year. Amazon said the facility could power the equivalent of 46,000 U.K. homes and would be the U.K.'s ""largest corporate wind power purchase agreement."" Additionally, two solar projects in North Carolina and Virginia will amount to 215 MW of total capacity, with Amazon expecting them to produce 500,997 MWh per year. The projects announced Thursday are expected to start generating energy in 2021. They are not owned by the company, but it says its commitment to purchase their output enables the projects to be built. In a statement issued Thursday, Amazon's Director of Sustainability Kara Hurst said the firm was ""committed to minimizing our carbon emissions and reaching 80% renewable energy use across the company by 2024.""In June, Amazon was one of more than 700 firms targeted by 88 investors ""for not reporting environmental information."" The aim of the investors was to push businesses such as Amazon to disclose information via the CDP, a not-for-profit platform which enables companies to divulge environmental performance data.A few months earlier, in April, thousands of Amazon employees signed an open letter to CEO Jeff Bezos and the firm's board of directors, imploring them to take action on climate change.In September, Amazon co-founded an initiative called The Climate Pledge, which asks signatories to become ""net zero carbon across their businesses"" by the year 2040.It has also launched what it calls a ""transparency website"" which it uses to report on what it describes as its ""sustainability commitments, initiatives, and performance."" The site also has information on the firm's carbon footprint, which it reports as being 44.40 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent for the 2018 fiscal year.Amazon is just one of many global technology firms looking to power operations using renewable sources of energy. In March 2019, for example, Microsoft signed a 15-year power purchase agreement for the energy produced by a 74-megawatt solar power facility in North Carolina, while in April 2018 Apple announced its global facilities were powered using ""100 percent clean energy.""Making sure that its facilities are powered by clean energy is a multi-faceted process for Apple.In its Environmental Responsibility Report covering the 2018 fiscal year the California-headquartered firm said that, where feasible, it sourced renewable energy by building its own projects. In addition, it invests capital to become a part owner in wind and solar projects and signs ""long-term renewable energy contracts."""
2019-11-06,White House will hire two high-profile aides to run impeachment messaging,0.06226387249114523,"As the House impeachment inquiry enters a new, public phase, the White House communications office is expected to add two longtime Trump allies to its staff, where they will be tasked with running a proactive impeachment messaging operation, CNBC confirmed Tuesday.Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a longtime Trump supporter, and Tony Sayegh, a former Treasury Department spokesman, are both expected to join the White House shortly to work specifically on impeachment related communications, in addition to other special projects as necessary, a senior administration official told CNBC. Bondi and Sayegh's jobs would be temporary,.Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney is ""very pleased"" with the Bondi and Sayegh hires, a senior administration official told CNBC. Mulvaney believes they will ""help round things out"" as good communicators with strong political skills.The hiring of Bondi and Sayegh, both high-profile political veterans, represents a new, more offensive posture from the White House, which has struggled to devise a cohesive strategy in response to the growing House impeachment inquiry.Trump has so far been resistant to the idea of a special team of staffers who would focus solely on the impeachment, reportedly because he was concerned such an approach was passe in the age of Twitter and social media.""Here's the thing: I don't have teams,"" Trump told reporters at the White House recently. ""Everyone is talking about teams. I'm the team. I did nothing wrong.""The choices of Bondi and Sayegh come as little surprise to those in Trump's inner circle. Bondi's term as attorney general in Florida ended earlier this year, and in the ensuing months, her name has come up repeatedly as a potential Trump hire, either at the Justice Department or the White House.Bondi made headlines during Trump's presidential campaign for accepting a $25,000 contribution to her political action committee from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, an apparent violation of rules prohibiting donations from nonprofits to PACs.The money was donated in 2013, when the Florida Attorney General's office was considering whether to join a lawsuit against Trump's now-defunct Trump University. The donation came a few days after Bondi announced that Florida might join the suit. Bondi ultimately decided the state would not take part in the lawsuit.Sayegh is a well-known Republican communications guru, having worked on several high-profile races and most recently as the most visible frontman for the GOP's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Trump's massive tax reform package. Within the White House, Sayegh is considered an ally of Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor.Politico recently reported that Sayegh's potential hiring had set off a turf war inside the West Wing, with some factions strongly backing the choice and others fearful it would give Kushner and his allies too much power over the impeachment communications strategy.— CNBC's Eamon Javers contributed to this report."

Its long-awaited streaming service, Disney+, is set to launch on November 12.Monster Beverage — Shares of the energy drink maker gained more than 3% after the company beat earnings and revenue estimates for the third quarter. Sales rose 11%, and the company also announced a $500 million share repurchase program.Gap — The apparel retailer's stock fell 7% after the company announced that CEO Art Peck would be stepping down, effective immediately. The company also warned that its results for the current quarter would be weaker-than-expected. The slide in the stock price wiped $466 million from the company's value.Zillow — Zillow's stock popped more than 12% after it reported a loss 12 cents per share for the third quarter, smaller than the 21 cents a share loss for which Wall Street was preparing. The real estate website operator's revenue came in above estimates, and it gave an upbeat forecast as well.Take-Two Interactive — Take-Two rose 2.3% after reporting a better-than-expected $2.02 per share in profit for its fiscal second quarter.

Teradata posted a profit of 32 cents per share on $459 million in revenue. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expected earnings per share of 40 cents on $486 million in revenue. The company also issued soft earnings guidance for the current quarter and announced CEO Oliver Ratzesberger resigned, effective immediately.Dropbox — Dropbox slid nearly 6% despite better-than-expected earnings. The cloud storage company earned 13 cents per share in the third quarter, 2 cents ahead of estimates, according to Refinitiv. Its revenue also topped estimates. The company said it is benefiting from its new desktop app as well as good results from its Dropbox Spaces collaboration software.SurveyMonkey — Shares of online cloud-based survey company tanked 9% after the company reported disappointing third-quarter earnings. The company reported a loss of 12 cents per share, while analysts were expecting a loss of 5 cents per share, according to Refinitiv. Revenue came in at $79.3 million, which beat estimates of $77.95 million.– CNBC's Yun Li, Pippa Stevens, Fred Imbert and Maggie Fitzgerald contributed to this report."
2019-11-25,Uber fallout: Here's the level to watch as stock falls on London ban,-0.014682979622004017,"Uber could still make a U-turn.That's according to JC O'Hara, chief market technician at MKM Partners, who told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Friday that breaching one key level could greatly bolster the stock's bull case.Uber shares have endured a great deal of push-and-pull in recent days, sent higher on Friday by positive analyst notes from Stifel and SunTrust, but tipped into a 1% decline on Monday after the city of London stripped the ride-hailing giant of its license to operate there — Uber's biggest European market. The order is on hold as Uber appeals the decision.Looking at Uber's chart since its IPO — which, as of Monday, displayed a painful 36% decline from the debut price — O'Hara saw some hope for the stock.""I can really appreciate this recent short-term positive momentum, especially after we got past the lockup expiration earlier this month,"" O'Hara said. Since the  on Nov. 6, current and former insiders including ex-CEO Travis Kalanick,have sold large blocks of shares. ""But ... if we take a step back and look at the six-month chart, we find that we are still in a defined downtrend,"" O'Hara said. ""We have price trading below a declining 50-day moving average. We have a series of lower highs in place as well as lower lows. So, I think it might be too premature to say the worst is behind us.""Still, O'Hara said one level would determine Uber's ability to turn around.""If we do manage to push up and break above the October highs in that $34-35 area, I think I would be a little bit more confident at that point in time that the worst is behind us, and the base suggests that we can move higher at that point,"" the technical analyst said.Uber shares were just above the $29 level in early Monday trading.Steve Chiavarone, equity strategist, vice president and portfolio manager at Federated, wasn't as confident that Uber could find an upward catalyst.""I think scalability is the issue,"" Chiavarone said in Friday's segment. ""We focus on incremental margins. You've got insurance costs here that grow as the company expands, and that raises questions about scalability. So, as we evaluate IPOs, particularly through our Kaufmann Growth franchise, what we're looking for is companies that are asset-light, can scale the business and are generating incremental margins. I'm not sure we find that here.""Chiavarone added that his firm was not yet exposed to the ride-hailing space, citing its stringent guidelines for investing in newly public names.""What we're looking for are those companies where we can see a clear pathway to cash-flow growth because that ultimately is going to be where the value is, and so we have not played this space,"" he said.Earlier this year, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told CNBC that he expected the company to be profitable by 2021.Disclaimer"
2019-12-05,"Elon Musk testifies in defamation trial that his net worth is around $20 billion, not much in cash",0.050862068965517246,"Elon Musk testified under oath he's not sure know how much he's worth.The Tesla and SpaceX CEO made the comment Wednesday in his second day of testimony in a defamation lawsuit filed by Vernon Unsworth, the British caver whom Musk called a ""pedo guy"" on Twitter.Musk apologized for the tweet during his first day of testimony in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Tuesday. He also argued then, and reiterated on Wednesday, that when he wrote ""pedo guy"" he meant ""creepy old man."" Musk also argued that, essentially, Unsworth picked a fight with him.Unsworth's attorney L. Lin Wood asked Musk on Wednesday whether Musk believed his ""pedo guy"" comment impacted Tesla shares. Musk said he had ""received concerned notes from shareholders."" The testimony ended with Wood asking about Musk's net worth. Over the objections of defense Alex Spiro, the judge allowed the question, saying ""Let's give everyone a headline.""Musk testified that he didn't know his precise net worth, and the value fluctuates on a daily basis. He said he owns stock in Tesla and SpaceX and has debt against his stock but he does not have a lot of cash. Asked if $20 billion was a reasonable estimate, Musk said he didn't know, but ""I think SpaceX and Tesla stock probably amount to that.""The dispute between Musk and Unsworth began in the summer of 2018, when Unsworth, a spelunker and expert diver, led the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave in Thailand.Before the rescue was completed, Musk had endeavored to involve himself, and employees from his companies SpaceX and Tesla, in the rescue. They created a rescue pod, or miniature submersible, that ultimately proved of no use in the rescue effort.Musk and his team pressured Thai officials to make favorable public statements about their involvement, while the rescue was still in progress and the boys' lives were at risk.Once the boys and their coach were safe, Unsworth was asked in an interview on CNN what he thought of Musk. He characterized Musk's efforts as a publicity stunt and said the Tesla CEO should ""stick his submarine where it hurts.""In court this week, Musk contended that when he called the cave rescue hero a ""pedo guy"" on Twitter, he was just responding to Unsworth's ""unprovoked attack,"" with similarly heated rhetoric, not meant as a literal accusation of pedophilia.At one point in his testimony, Musk said: ""I assume he literally didn't mean to sodomize me with a submarine. I literally didn't mean he was a pedophile.""Judge Stephen Wilson emphasized that the outcome of the defamation case hinges on whether or not a reasonable person, given context, would interpret the ""pedo guy"" tweet as Musk labeling Unsworth an actual pedophile.Unsworth will also have to prove that he suffered damages as a result of the alleged defamation.In court on Tuesday and Wednesday, Musk clashed frequently with Wood, to the point where the judge warned ""Let's cut the repartee. ... That's an order, not an invitation to a dance.""—CNBC's Jane Wells and Paul McNamara and Reuters contributed to this report.Follow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech industry news.Editor's Note"

Tulsi Gabbard sued former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday for allegedly defaming her by suggesting the Hawaii congresswoman is a ""Russian asset.""""Clinton's false assertions were made in a deliberate attempt to derail Tulsi's campaign,"" said the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.The suit claims that Gabbard has suffered ""actual damages"" of ""$50 million — and counting"" from Clinton's comments. But the suit does not cite a specific amount of damages it is seeking.Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee who previously was a senator from New York, said in an October interview that an unnamed Democratic presidential candidate was ""the favorite of the Russians.""Clinton did not mention Gabbard, a four-term congresswoman, by name in that interview with the podcast ""Campaign HQ With David Plouffe.""But Clinton's spokesman, Nick Merrill, said after the interview that ""If the nesting doll fits,"" when asked if she had been referring to Gabbard, who is also a major in the Army National Guard and a combat veteran of Iraq.Merrill later said in a tweet that Clinton was referring to the Republican Party grooming Gabbard. But it is Russians, not the GOP, who are known for making nesting, or Matryoshka dolls.Clinton, wife of President Bill Clinton, lost the 2016 election to Republican nominee Donald Trump.The report by special counsel Robert Mueller as well as a probe by the Senate Intelligence Committee have both found that Russian agents tried to damage Clinton's candidacy, and that they tried to promote the third-party candidacy of Green Party nominee Jill Stein in order to harm Clinton's chances of winning the White House.When asked about the suit, Merrill told NBC News on Wednesday, ""That's ridiculous.""The suit suggests that Clinton smeared Gabbard with a false accusation in ""retribution"" for Gabbard's endorsement of Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders in his 2016 candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination.""Clinton — a cutthroat politician by any account — has never forgotten this perceived slight,"" said Gabbard's suit, which also names the congresswoman's presidential campaign committee as a plaintiff.Clinton ""lied about her perceived rival"" for reasons that could include ""personal animus, political enmity, or fear of real change within a political party Clinton and her allies have long dominated.""Clinton ""did so publicly, unambiguously, and with obvious malicious intent,"" the suit claimed."

""But the consumer seems to be robust around the world — yes, ups and downs, but they're doing pretty well.""The International Monetary Fund on Monday revised its forecasts downward for 2019 and 2020, mostly due to slowing growth in India. The IMF also warned about uncertainty related to trade, which would weigh on the global economy.At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, business leaders have expressed doubts that China and the United States will reach phase two of a trade deal before the end of President Donald Trump's first term.Still, Quincey said that the company is confident about consumer spending in 2019 and sees momentum heading into 2020. In October, Coke's third-quarter revenue beat analyst estimates as consumers spent money on healthier options, like Zero Sugar soda and smaller size cans.The beverage giant will report its fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 30."
2020-01-27,Fed likely to reassure markets that it is watchful of coronavirus impact,0.03156410256410256,"The Fed is not expected to take any action on its benchmark fed funds rate this week, but it is likely to reassure markets that it is watching the outbreak of the coronavirus and other geopolitical uncertainties.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to brief the press after the Fed releases its statement Wednesday afternoon, and it is in those comments investors will likely get the most insight into the Fed's thinking. The Fed starts its two-day meeting Tuesday.""They might say something about paying attention to global developments, but I wouldn't expect them to do anything at this point,"" said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. Strategists expect the Fed has been watching tensions in the Middle East and now the coronavirus.""They're looking at the global economy and it doesn't look like it will have much affect at the moment,"" he said. It is still unclear how serious the virus will become, or how it will impact the Chinese and other economies. By Monday, the virus had affected 2,900 people and killed 82.On the policy side, the Fed is expected to hold rates steady and not signal any other moves.""I think the Fed will be silent,"" said Joseph Quinlan, head of CIO market strategy at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank. ""They've come into 2020 with their work done. This is a political year. They've done their job when it comes to cutting rates. I think they're in wait-and-see mode.""The biggest issue for markets is when the Fed will slow and ultimately stop its purchases of Treasury bills, an effort credited by some for a surge in liquidity that has helped boost risk assets, particularly stocks, and tighten credit spreads. The Fed began purchasing $60 billion a month to expand its balance sheet and increases reserves, after problems in the short-term funding market created a temporary snap up in overnight rates.The Fed has calmed the short-term lending market with the purchases and also ongoing repurchase, or repo, operations. It has said it would continue its operations to help the repo market through the tax season, when there could be higher-than-normal demand for short-term cash. The repo market is basically the plumbing for the financial markets and is where financial institutions go for short term cash.""It would be nice if they did discuss it, but I don't know if they're going to or not,"" said John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets. Briggs said he doesn't expect Powell to reveal much in the way of specifics on how it will wind down its Treasury bill purchases. He expects the Fed to say in March that it is paring back those purchases from $60 billion to $40 billion, and then will taper them down.BlackRock's Rick Rieder said he will be listening for how the Fed describes inflation since it has said it is willing to let it run ""hotter"" than its 2% target, though the measure it watches has not yet met the target. He, too, is looking for clarification on the Fed's plans for its T-bill buying program.He expects the Fed to discuss it by mid-second quarter. ""I think they'll start to taper it down, and I think they'll be very deliberate and prescriptive about how they're going to do that,"" said Rieder, BlackRock's global CIO of fixed income.He said the Fed is adding a lot of liquidity to the financial system on its own, but it is even more massive when combined with the efforts of the People's Bank of China and the European Central Bank.""I think they'll start to taper down the program some time during or toward the middle or the end of the second quarter,"" he said. ""My sense is they're beginning the discussions but those discussions will gather momentum in the next month or two.""Rieder said he expects more Fed officials to become concerned about their policy causing too easy financial conditions, boosting stocks and tightening credit spreads. ""My sense is that's going to be very slow in incubating that idea.""""The one thing I've got my eye on is I think at some point in the next couple of months, assuming what is happening now is a relatively near term risk, I think a lot of the discussion is going to head toward financial conditions,"" Rieder said. ""You've had some of the Fed members talking about financial conditions.""The Fed is also expected to boost the interest rate on excess reserves by five basis points. That's a technical tool that it would hope would push its fed funds rate slightly higher. The fed funds rate has been at 1.55%, the low end of its 1.50 to 1.75% range.""Historically, the Fed has made these adjustments when the funds rate has been trading within 5 basis points of the borders of the target range, as it has recently,"" notes JPMorgan chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli. ""The markets and the public seem to have understood that these technical adjustments do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy and we expect that to continue to be the case next week."""
2020-02-06,"Obama response to 2016 Russian election meddling had 'many flaws,' Senate report finds",0.08479125896934116,"The Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday issued its long-awaited report on how former President Barack Obama handled Russian meddling in the 2016 election.The bipartisan report found that the Obama administration was ill-prepared to handle the novel election interference offensive and recommended that in the future the ""public should be informed as soon as possible"" if a foreign active measures campaign is detected.""After discovering the existence, if not the full scope, of Russia's election interference efforts in late-2016, the Obama Administration struggled to determine the appropriate response,"" the committee's GOP chairman, Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, said in a statement.""Frozen by 'paralysis of analysis,' hamstrung by constraints both real and perceived, Obama officials debated courses of action without truly taking one,"" he said.Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the committee's top Democrat, said that there were ""many flaws"" with the Obama administration's response but noted that ""many of those were due to problems with our own system – problems that can and should be corrected.""The report was released one day after President Donald Trump was acquitted by the Senate of a charge that he abused his power by seeking to pressure the government of Ukraine to open investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden. He was also acquitted of a charge of obstruction of Congress. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.Trump, who spent the first two years of his presidency dogged by a federal investigation into whether he unlawfully conspired with the Russian government in the 2016 election, has criticized Obama for his handling of the situation.""He did NOTHING, and had no intention of doing anything!"" Trump wrote in a post on Twitter last year.The U.S. intelligence community concluded in 2017 that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign during the 2016 campaign targeting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and that the Russian government had a ""clear preference"" for Trump.The attacks included the pilfering of data and emails from Democratic National Committee networks which were then released to outlets including WikiLeaks, an anti-secrecy group, in a manner designed to raise doubts about Clinton's viability.The Senate Intelligence Committee also concluded that the Russian government sought to bolster Trump's 2016 election chances.Former special counsel Robert Mueller, who led the investigation into Trump's campaign, concluded that Trump expected to benefit from Russian interference. Mueller, however, did not establish coordination between Trump's associates and the Russian disinformation campaign.Trump tweetThe Senate report released Thursday is the third, out of an expected five, stemming from the committee's probe into the government's handling of Russian meddling efforts. The investigation began in 2017 and has proceeded on a largely bipartisan basis, in contrast with parallel congressional inquiries.The committee found that the Obama administration was ""not well-postured"" to counter the Russian interference campaign and said that while ""high-level warnings were delivered to Russian officials, those warnings may or may not have tempered Moscow's activity.""Obama said in 2016 that he confronted Putin over allegations that the Russian leader ordered the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, telling him to ""cut it out.""The committee noted that institutional constraints prevented the administration from acting more aggressively. The report documents members of the administration agonizing over the potential that a public statement about the hacking efforts — while Obama was actively campaigning for Clinton — would be perceived as political.""Those factors included the highly politicized environment, concern that public warnings would themselves undermine confidence in the election, and a delay in definitive attribution to Russia, among other issues,"" the report said.It noted that most administration officials first learned about the Russian hacking efforts from a June 2016 article in The Washington Post. In October of that year, the administration released its first public statement saying that the intelligence community was ""confident"" that the Russian government directed cyberattacks on American political organizations.The committee emphasized that in case of future attacks, the public should be notified ""as soon as possible with a clear and succinct statement of the threat.""""If the Administration had informed the public of Russian hacking and dumping earlier than October 7, and had there been bipartisan condemnation of these operations, the public and the press may have reacted differently to the WikiLeaks releases,"" the committee wrote.""At the least, stories about Democratic emails might have mentioned that their release was part of a Russian influence campaign and that Donald Trump's repeated references to the releases, his stated adoration of WikiLeaks, and his solicitation of Russian assistance were taking place in the context of an ongoing influence campaign to assist him,"" it said.The committee will release two more reports on its findings. Those will cover the intelligence community's 2017 assessment of Russian interference and the committee's final counterintelligence findings. The committee did not say when those reports will be released.A spokesperson for Obama did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

2020-03-31,US dollar weakens as Fed measure weighs,0.046367521367521376,"The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday modestly pressured by the weight of Federal Reserve measures meant to ensure there was enough liquidity in the global financial system.The dollar earlier in the session benefited from quarterly and fiscal year-end demand from portfolio managers and Japanese firms, but trading was choppy, with the dollar alternating between gains and losses.For the quarter, the dollar was the biggest gainer, rising 2.8%. The Norwegian crown was the biggest loser, falling 18% against the dollar.Analysts said the steep fall in U.S. equity markets during March led to increased buying of dollars for asset managers seeking to rebalance their portfolios at the end of the month.But the U.S. currency pared gains in the aftermath of the latest Fed move on Tuesday to expand the ability of dozens of foreign central banks to access dollars during the coronavirus crisis. Essentially, the Fed is allowing foreign central banks to exchange their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities for overnight dollar loans.It is one of a slew of measures that the Fed unleashed to address liquidity problems caused by the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.That has dented the dollar's luster a bit as the supply of the U.S. currency expands.""The dollar will struggle to extend gains significantly at the moment just because of the relative supply of cash coming in from the Fed in dollar terms,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.In afternoon trading, the dollar index was down 0.2% on the day at 99.042.It reached 102.99, its highest in more than three years, earlier this month as a global market sell-off fueled a rush for dollars. Dollar demand has ebbed, but analysts are still forecasting more dollar gains. Against the yen, the dollar slipped 0.2% to 107.57 yen. For the quarter, the dollar was down 1.1%.Tuesday was the last trading day of Japan's fiscal year and the end of the quarter for major investors elsewhere, which has fueled some volatility as big currency market players close their books. The bulk of those positioning changes caused the dollar to strengthen earlier.The dollar also weakened after data showed U.S. consumer confidence dropped to a near three-year low in March as households worried about the economy's near-term outlook amid the coronavirus pandemic.The euro, meanwhile, was down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.1007, falling 1.8% in the first quarter.Some analysts believed that the dollar is likely to remain supported as investors brace for a sharp economic downturn in the coming quarters.""The Fed's efforts so far are the closest thing to taming the dollar's strength,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.""But the desire to hold dollars remains elevated ahead of what's expected to be a punishing second quarter for U.S. and global growth."""
2020-04-06,"Coronavirus mortgage bailout: 'There is going to be complete chaos,' says industry CEO",0.05175324675324675,"A broad coalition of mortgage and finance industry leaders on Saturday sent a plea to federal regulators, asking for desperately needed cash to keep the mortgage system running during the coronavirus pandemic, as requests from borrowers for the federal mortgage forbearance program are pouring in at an alarming rate.The Cares Act, which seeks to limit the economic damage from COVID-19, mandates that all borrowers with government-backed mortgages — about 62% of all first lien mortgages according to Urban Institute — be allowed to delay at least 90 days of monthly payments and possibly up to a year's worth.Those payments would then have to be made at a later time through a payment plan. Servicers are granting the payment deferrals to borrowers with no questions asked, as is required by the law, but the servicers still have to pay mortgage bond holders.In normal times, they have enough to cover these payments, and, in fact, at the end of last year the mortgage delinquency rate was near a record low, according to CoreLogic. Now that rate is skyrocketing, and servicers do not have nearly enough cash to cover those payments to bondholders.The coalition, which includes the Mortgage Bankers Association, the National Association of Home Builders, the National Association of Realtors, the Independent Community Bankers of America, U.S. Mortgage Insurers and the National Apartment Association, issued a press release Saturday saying, ""The scale of this forbearance program could not have been foreseen by mortgage servicers, or fully anticipated by regulators ... it is therefore incumbent upon the government to provide a liquidity facility for single-family and multifamily servicers ... any further delay could lead to greater uncertainty and volatility in the market.""Mr. Cooper, the largest nonbank servicer in the nation, with close to 4 million mostly government-backed loans has already granted more than 80,000 forbearances, and the requests keep flooding in. Jay Bray, Mr. Cooper's CEO, helped federal regulators set up the plan. He said he was told there would be federal cash for servicers, but that part of the deal never made it to the final act.""It's frankly frustrating and ridiculous that we do not have a solution in place,"" said Bray. ""There is going to be complete chaos. We're the largest nonbank. We have a strong balance sheet, but for the industry as a whole you're going to start seeing problems soon.""In an interview Wednesday on CNBC, Mark Calabria, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said he estimated about 2 million borrowers would seek forbearance by May. He did not agree that servicers need liquidity now, only later.""If this goes beyond two or three months, and we start to get worse than that, then that's going to be a lot of strain, and certainly we're going to start to see some firms get into a lot of liquidity trouble,"" Calabria said.Others, however, have much higher estimates for the forbearance program. Laurie Goodman, co-director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at Urban Institute, predicted a worst-case scenario of nearly 12 million borrowers receiving some kind of forbearance at a cost of $66 billion for six months. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, predicted about 15 million households would receive some forbearance on their home loans.""We had a tremendous surge in April, you're going to see another massive surge in the middle of the month when they [borrowers] are considered late, and another massive surge in May,"" said Bray. ""They're going to need these forbearance plans, and it's going to continue to grow at a pace that, frankly, some people don't understand and are dismissing how big a problem it's going to be.""Even as Americans begin to receive checks from the government, there is no guarantee they will use that money to pay their mortgages. The forbearance program forbids servicers from asking for any proof of hardship. Bray said that was the right course.""I do not believe it is a moral hazard. It's not a payment forgiveness plan. Let's say it's three month, at the end of that time they can repay, go onto partial payment, or go into some type of modification, and then there will be some kind of documentation required,"" said Bray. But others disagree.""Throwing this out there without showing evidence of hardship was an outrageous move, outrageous,"" said David Stevens, who headed the Federal Housing Administration during the subprime mortgage crisis and is a former CEO of the Mortgage Bankers Association. ""The administration made a huge mistake bringing moral hazard in and thrust extraordinary risk into the private sector that could collapse the mortgage market.""Stevens said borrowers should have been required to show at least some proof of hardship, which they had to do during subprime mortgage bailout. Moral hazard aside, he, too, contended a liquidity facility for servicers is essential.""This is a crisis so easily correctable,"" he said. ""The GSEs [Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac] for years have always assured the servicing community that in the event of a major credit event, they'll be there to make sure they provide the liquidity. From what we are hearing, and we can't verify it, the FHFA director instructed the GSEs not to set up a liquidity or advance facility.""When asked for a response to the industry plea, Calabria on Monday declined to comment.Both Stevens and Bray said that because of this new and momentous risk in the mortgage market, it is suddenly much harder for borrowers to get new loans or refinance current mortgages. Wells Fargo is already placing restrictions on jumbo lending to its customers.""It's just going to create more fear within the nonbank servicing sector. The banks that service them are going to start to not lend,"" said Bray. ""Ultimately that impacts homeowners. They won't be able to be served because these companies will be in the middle of a crisis. We've seen a lot of businesses close their doors, and if you start closing the doors of servicers you're impacting people's lives much more than other sectors. You're talking about their homes. It's the largest asset they have."""

He cited the effectiveness of social distancing measures and applauded the country's residents for taking them seriously. There are more than 128,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Germany and around 3,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Spahn said the German government is now seeking to find ""the right balance"" between health and economic considerations. ""I would say it's not the health of people versus the economy because they are very much interlinked,"" Spahn said. ""You need a strong economy to have a well-equipped health system, for example. Or unemployment, a recession, is harmful for the mental and physical health of people, too."" Germany has received praise, albeit with some caution, for its response to the Covid-19 outbreak. Spahn said he was ""humble"" but not ""overconfident"" about how Germany has handled the spread of the coronavirus.He cited the strength of Germany's health-care system, in particular its high number of intensive care unit beds, as one reason why the country was well equipped to respond to the pandemic. The country also placed an early emphasis on testing capacity, Spahn said. He said the the country had a strong network of labs, and he noted that the first diagnostic test for Covid-19 was developed in Germany in January. ""It's like pointing a flashlight into the dark,"" Spahn said of testing. ""If you don't do it, you'll just see different shades of gray. With extensive testing, you can really see what's going on.

For retirees fearful of depleting their savings, this can offer a regular income stream without having to sell assets. While not all stocks have slashed dividends — at least 57 have increased them this year — relying solely on those payments for income may be missing the bigger picture.""Investors may have to shift their mindset about what it means to generate income from their portfolios,"" said certified financial planner Adam Reinert, chief investment officer with Marshall Financial Group in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.""If you think about what income means, is it really just dividends and [bond payments], or is it cash flow from the portfolio as a whole?"" he said.In other words, Reinert said, think of dividends, interest and growth of assets as the building blocks of an income stream. That way, he said, you can reduce some risk that comes with too heavy a focus on those income yields (payments as a share of the asset price).""If you just focus on dividends or coupon payments, you might see something with a higher yield, say 6%, but it could be riskier,"" Reinert said. ""Maybe the price is falling, or the dividend hasn't been adjusted yet.""Retirees also could use the bucket approach — using fixed-income investments, such as U.S. treasury bonds — to plan for income over a multi-year period. ""You effectively cover your living expenses for five or seven or 10 years by buying the appropriate fixed-income investments to match that time horizon,"" said CFP Michael Hennessy, founder and CEO of Harbor Crest Wealth Advisors in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. ""Then, the remaining funds in your retirement account can be invested to capture long-term equity growth.""It also may be worthwhile upgrading your dividend stock holdings by replacing companies with weaker balance sheets — and more at risk of cutting dividends — with those whose financials suggest they are in better shape to continue paying, said Shon Anderson, a CFP and president of Anderson Financial Strategies in Dayton, Ohio. Some companies have consistently paid dividends for 25 years, or even 50 years or more, he said.""The company board of directors, and executive management, know that a growing dividend is extremely important to the majority of their shareholders and will protect it at all costs, even if it isn't necessarily the optimum short-term solution,"" Anderson said.More from Personal Finance:Here's how are unemployment benefits are taxedThis is what happens to your unpaid debt at deathCard issuers cutting credit limits without warningEven if a company cuts its dividend, they may resume or increase them once their finances are stronger.""They're likely to bring them back,"" Anderson said. ""But the reason they've had to reduce them is distress in their business, so it probably won't be in the near future.""Silverblatt, of S&P Dow Jones Indices, anticipates dividend cuts to be more prevalent among smaller and mid-sized public companies as the economy struggles to right itself.""I expect those companies to feel it the most,"" Silverblatt said.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."
2020-05-26,"Ad shift from TV to digital will speed up even more because of coronavirus, Goldman Sachs says",0.08564814814814814,"Ad budgets were already shifting from TV to digital before the coronavirus pandemic, but that's going to speed up, according to a Europe-focused report by Goldman Sachs.""Overall, we expect the crisis will only accelerate the secular shift in advertising budgets towards digital, while potentially also leading to more attempts by the EU broadcasters to seek further partnerships and M&A (mergers and acquisitions) to share costs and build scale,"" according to the company's Europe Media: Broadcasting report, seen by CNBC.Brands are able to measure the impact of online ads more easily than those on TV, and digital ads tend to be cheaper — and it appears the pandemic has had more of an impact on TV ad revenue than digital. TV ad revenue in Europe was down by about 50% in April, while the results of the major digital players were generally above expectations, Goldman noted. Google search revenue was ""down mid-teens,"" while Facebook's revenue growth for the first three weeks of April was flat and Snap's went up 15% in April, the report added.A separate report from the World Advertising Research Center (WARC) showed that global marketing budgets for digital advertising in April fell for the first time since WARC started tracking spend in 2012. Advertising in printed newspapers and magazines saw the steepest declines followed by outdoor billboards, radio and TV.Advertising is typically one of the first things businesses cut back on during recessions and this year's TV Upfronts in the U.S., where broadcast networks woo marketers, have been delayed indefinitely. Many of the companies surveyed in a report by consultancy Advertiser Perceptions said they could replace the reach of traditional TV ads with those in streaming services or via digital video ads.A lack of demand for media buys has also made ad spots cheaper, according to WARC data. For example, the cost of digital video ads was forecast to go up by 6.7% globally by media audit company ECI Media Management but is only likely to increase by 1.3%, per WARC. In terms of recovery, ad spend has historically shown a good relationship with economic growth, Goldman noted, with every 1% change to GDP usually translating to ad revenue growth going up two to three times.However, the post-pandemic recovery is likely to be less significant than the one after the 2008-2009 recession. The global TV ad market grew 14% in 2010 after a 7% decline in 2009 per figures from Magna Global, and Goldman expects European broadcasters to see growth of only 6% after an 18% decline this year.Broadcasters are also likely to be more open to partnerships and M&A, Goldman noted, with Italian broadcaster Mediaset set to acquire a 25% stake in Germany's ProSieben this year, for example. The report's authors also expect more partnerships in streaming services — in the U.K., ITV and the BBC launched Britbox in November.Broadcast stocks were the worst-performing sector in the European media market according to Goldman's report, down 41% on average year-to-date. This compares to a 27% decline for companies in the STOXX 600 Media, an index of European stocks.Goldman expects net annualized returns to decline between 30% and 50% for European broadcasters in the second quarter, with French channels including TF1 and M6 decreasing the most, and German broadcasters RTL and ProSieben being impacted the least."
2020-06-01,Some voters are scared the coronavirus will stop them from casting a ballot,0.13532982890125747,"Erica Friedle had not missed a vote in seven years. Then came the coronavirus pandemic.Friedle told CNBC she didn't receive her absentee ballot for April's Wisconsin presidential primary. And now she fears that a lack of preparation by state officials and the continued threat of the disease might force her to sit out the upcoming November election in the swing state. As health officials predict that the pandemic might last into the fall, many states are beginning to plan for the likelihood of people opting to vote by mail instead of showing up in person, where the risk of contracting and spreading the coronavirus is greater. For some people, the coronavirus has made voting a nerve-wracking action. Some Americans and voting rights groups are concerned that the pandemic is forcing voters to choose between avoiding contact with people to stay healthy and exercising their right to vote. Come November, these concerns might linger.""Are people going to want to stay in line to vote? Are people going to be requesting absentee ballots? Do people even have the technology to request a ballot online?"" Friedle asked, listing out some of her immediate worries in an interview with CNBC. ""There are so many unknowns right now.""The Wisconsin primary in particular has been criticized for its disorganization and last-minute changes, leading to voter confusion and disenfranchisement and serves as an example of what voting rights groups hope will not happen in November.Complicating matters, President Donald Trump and members of the Republican Party are on the attack against widespread mail-in voting while Democrats push for expanded access. Late last month, Trump threatened to withhold funding from Michigan and Nevada for expanding their mail-in voting services in an effort to avoid crowded polling centers during the coronavirus pandemic. ""More and more states are allowing vote-by-mail without voters having to provide a reason or excuse for it,"" said Andrea Hailey, CEO of Vote.org, a nonprofit focusing on advancing voter ballot access. ""Other states are mailing applications to voters, which is critical for ensuring that all voters can participate in the electoral process.""More than half, or 54%, of Americans said they would back voting by mail in the upcoming presidential election if the pandemic persists, according to an April Morning Consult poll. And 66% of surveyed Americans said in March that they were concerned about voting in person during the coronavirus outbreak. ""We are seeing signs that voters are registering at numbers unseen from our organization, and that they are very much interested in voting by absentee,"" Hailey told CNBC in an email.But mail-in voting can bring its own concerns, especially if there are underlying circumstances that affect support, such as the potential for U.S. Postal Service operation failure or miscommunication between state officials and voters.Friedle, a second-grade teacher, said she applied for an absentee ballot but did not receive it ahead of the Wisconsin presidential primary on April 7. She is a single mother with a 10-year-old child, sharing custody with her ex-husband, a scientist at a large pharmaceutical company who at the time of the primary had been working on a vaccine for Covid-19.The combination of being unable to leave her child alone and fearing getting sick at the polls made Friedle miss the vote.  ""I didn't want to put myself at risk for getting sick,"" she said. ""I've been taking care of my daughter the whole time. Her father works crazy hours, and at that time, he was telling me he might get locked out in his work, that he wouldn't be able to leave his work.""She added: ""That just made me nervous. Who's gonna watch my daughter?"" Friedle, 41, is not within the most vulnerable age group for contracting the most severe form of the virus. But there's still a lot at stake for people like Friedle: parents with young kids or teachers whose students are relying on them even as online classes persist. Knowing the risks, Friedle chose instead to skip out on voting. She feared if she contracted the virus, she would pass it on to her daughter or potentially be unable to teach. Voting rights groups stress that the most susceptible people are ""older voters and people with pre-existing conditions,"" according to Brett Edkins, political director at New York-based Stand Up America, a nonprofit focused on advancing Democratic goals. ""Children and younger parents are at relatively low risk of becoming seriously ill. Election experts across the partisan divide say that mail-in voting is the safest alternative to in-person voting.""But Friedle's experience during the Wisconsin primary gave her a taste of what November might look like for her and other voters across the nation, she said. She's hoping to see her state take action in the coming months to reduce the likelihood of people experiencing what she did. This includes ""having multiple ways to vote, whether you want to vote early, via an absentee ballot or in person.""At the same time, she's concerned about whether officials are considering the feasibility of these moves. ""How can we do that? How can we do it safely so people aren't being exposed to germs or viruses?"" she asked. ""Lots of organizations are out there that drive people to the polls. Are people still organizing these things with Covid going on?""In other states, some voters are concerned that there won't be enough done to make in-person voting safer. Angel Wells, a frequent voter and a self-described human rights activist based in Arizona, said that's what's driving her fears today. Voting can get chaotic in Arizona, said Wells, a veteran. In her voting area, ""there are 64 voting offices where you can cast your vote. But that's not enough when you live in a valley with millions of people.""""When people go out to vote, those lines are long. The polling booths are close [together]. They're not six feet apart. How are we supposed to have this vote and keep within health guidelines?"" ""People are rightly concerned about having to choose between their right to vote and their health,"" Edkins of Stand Up America said. ""I think we're hearing a lot of those concerns from our community and from voters everywhere.""Friedle's experience illustrates that much of the burden to acquire an absentee ballot was placed on her. She said she emailed the city clerk when she realized she didn't have her absentee ballot, asking for guidance in obtaining one. The city clerk shot back an email the day of the election, she told CNBC, attaching a ballot that needed to be printed, filled out and hand-delivered. Handing in the ballot wasn't worth the risk to her health, she said.The District of Columbia and 34 states, including five that conduct all-mail voting, use no-excuse absentee voting, according to the bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures. But even so, a lot of those states don't typically send out absentee ballots unless a registered voter requests one. California is the most recent state to announce that all registered voters will receive a mail-in ballot for November's election because of the challenges brought on by the pandemic.At the same time, voting rights groups and registered voters recognize that there will be people still opting to show up and vote at the polls in November. ""Expanding vote-by-mail options is exactly what more communities need, but we must also ensure that it is safe to vote in person,"" said Vote.org's Hailey. ""That is why it should be a top priority for governments at all levels to fully fund our elections, that we have at least 20 days of early voting and that poll workers can conduct our elections in sanitary, safe conditions for our communities to vote in person as well.""That's the question many states are trying to answer right now, grappling with early preparations for the execution of the November election and trying to rethink voting. ""Nobody who's under 100 years old has run an election during a pandemic,"" Edkins of Stand Up America said. To decrease the risk of spreading the coronavirus, state officials are going to have to ""train on a very local level to prepare people,"" he told CNBC. That includes finding ways to maintain a standard six feet of distance between voters, having hand sanitizer and personal protective equipment readily available, regularly disinfecting voting booths and employing cough guards. Officials also have to take into account how volunteers and poll workers will engage with voters, Edkins said. It's important to remember to keep ""distance from voters who are often right next to poll workers verifying their signatures and signing them in to vote. I think they're going to have to think through all those procedures.""Already, there's been considerable advancement in the nationwide expansion of ballot access, Edkins said, adding that ""most states are making good progress.""""Multiple states have added Covid as a reason and an excuse to get an absentee ballot.""Many of the voting changes transcend party lines, Edkins said. Vote-by-mail expansion is coming ""not just from Democratic states, but also Republican states with local election officials that are making these changes as well."" It's too early to tell how these changes will affect voter turnout in November. For some voters, the concern is that these changes may not be enough to get the highest participation level possible. ""Voting is incredibly important,"" Friedle said. ""It's our opportunity to put people in power to make a difference. The people who are making those choices have an impact in my life."""
2020-06-09,10-year Treasury yield falls to 0.8% as investors return to safety amid pause in stock rally,0.16189898989898993,"Treasury yields fell on Tuesday as the massive stock rally hit a pause. Investors also awaited the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note dropped 7 basis points to 0.81% and the yield on the 30-year bond was down 9 basis points at 1.56%. Yields move inversely to prices.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets Tuesday and will announce its latest monetary policy decision on Wednesday. While markets expect short-term interest rates to remain steady at near zero, investors will be watching Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's statement for clues over the central bank's next move.Powell intimated at last month's meeting that more stimulus could be necessary to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The Fed has already deployed an unprecedented barrage of rate cuts and credit and lending programs which could inject around $6 trillion into the economy.The National Bureau of Economic Research officially confirmed on Monday that the U.S. economy peaked in February, signaling the end to the longest economic expansion in American history, which began in June 2009.Market focus is also attuned to states' efforts to reopen their economies amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has now infected more than 1.9 million Americans and more than 7 million people worldwide.The World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday warned that the pandemic is ""far from over"" after a record number of new daily cases, and suggested that the virus has yet to peak in Central America.On the economic data front, the IBD/TIPP economic optimism survey for June is expected at 10 a.m. ET Tuesday, along with April JOLTs job openings and wholesale inventory figures.Auctions will be held Tuesday for $40 billion of 119-day Treasury bills, $60 billion of 42-day bills and $29 billion of 10-year notes."
2020-06-12,"The Fed's economic forecasts are all over the map, a sign of how uncertain these times are",0.08175666438824336,"The Federal Reserve's economic outlook isn't so much pessimistic as it is uncertain, with expectations running a wide gamut from a plodding recovery to a sharp rebound.If that sounds a lot like the market lately, it's probably not a coincidence.Following its two-day meeting earlier this week, the Fed released its Summary of Economic Projections for GDP, unemployment, inflation and interest rates. The estimates largely reflected the current unprecedented downturn followed by expectations for varying levels of growth ahead. Specifically on GDP, which measures goods and services produced and is the broadest yardstick for economic growth, the median figures in each of the three years for which estimates were provided masked wide disparities of views from the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee's 17 members.For 2020, the median expectation was for a GDP decline of 6.5%. But that was merely the midpoint of forecasts that ranged all the way from -10% to -4.2%. The difference gets even more pronounced in 2021, where the median is a 5% gain but the range goes from -1% — in essence, a continuation of the recession that started in February 2020 — to a 7% gain, which would be the fastest one-year growth rate since 1984.The outlook for unemployment and inflation all showed a substantial disparity of opinions.Such wide spreads over what the future holds now seem written in the financial markets and particularly stocks, which on Thursday suffered their worst one-day plunge since late March and now suddenly look wobbly after a stunning 2½-month run higher. The surge came against a bevy of jaw-dropping economic numbers that showed how much damage the pandemic has caused.""They've been pretty honest and straightforward about the high level of uncertainty that they see around how the economy's progressing, which is nice,"" Kathy Jones, head of fixed income for Charles Schwab, said of the Fed policymakers.""We all know the second quarter is the trough and things will get better and the market is trying to discount that,"" she added. ""But I think the markets got pretty carried away.""Indeed, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has been emphasizing that even with all of the rescue funding that the central bank and Congress have been providing, the strength of the recovery is largely dependent on the path of the coronavirus. Powell even noted at the end of this week's meeting that the SEP readings should be viewed cautiously. Because so much was unknown, the Fed declined to provide the quarterly summary at its main March policy meeting but elected to do so this week even with abundant questions about the future.""Given the unusually high level of uncertainty about the outlook, many participants noted that they see a number of reasonably likely paths for the economy and that's not possible to identify with confidence a single path as the most likely one,"" Powell said Wednesday, noting that the SEP was ""a full range of plausible outcomes and not one particular forecast.""At a time when fears of a second round of Covid-19 infections are heightened, the Fed's sketchy outlook helped precipitate a wicked Thursday market slide that was only partially offset by a Friday rally that continued to weaken as the day progressed. President Donald Trump weighed in Thursday, saying the Fed is ""wrong so often"" even though its 2021 forecast is for the fastest pace of growth since Ronald Reagan was president.The Fed offered no additional policy tools to help guide the economy through what promises to be a murky road ahead, only assurances that short-term benchmark interest rates would remain anchored near zero through at least 2022.The SEP ""showed a remarkably wide range of potential outcomes for the American economy over the next 2 years,"" wrote Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. ""Despite that, the Fed did not announce anything new [Wednesday] aside from some assurance that it will not employ negative interest rates.""Markets for the moment are no longer pricing in a chance that the Fed in fact would go to negative rates anytime soon, despite persistent speculation that it might follow the example of Europe and Japan if things continued to deteriorate.But the chasm of economic expectations between officials serves as a reminder of how in flux the future can be, even as investors continue to price in a best-case scenario.""In the end, equity markets have made their bullish bet about future corporate profits specifically and the state of the US economy more generally,"" Colas said. ""Even a Federal Reserve with an unabashedly uncertain outlook will not change that much."""

China reported 40 new cases as a new cluster in Beijing continued to grow. That new cluster, linked to a wholesale market in Beijing, could impact food shipments into China.New coronavirus cases and hospitalizations continue to rise in a handful of U.S. states, prompting warnings from some health officials that greater precautions might be necessary to keep the health systems from being overwhelmed. As people grow fatigued from social distancing and other precautions, pharmaceutical and biotech companies are racing forward to develop treatments and a vaccine for the virus. The coverage on this live blog has ended — but for up-to-the-minute coverage on the coronavirus, visit the live blog from CNBC's U.S. team. Global cases: More than 8.01 millionGlobal deaths: At least 436,306U.S. cases: More than 2.11 millionU.S. deaths: At least 116,135The data above was compiled by Johns Hopkins University as at 9:45 a.m. Singapore time.Switzerland's economy could lose more than $100 billion in output due to the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, the government said on Tuesday, Reuters reported.The government expects 2020 gross domestic product (GDP) to be around 652 billion Swiss francs ($687.26 billion), down from a forecast for 712 billion francs made in December. ""On a per capita basis the downturn is going to be as bad as the mid-1970s, if not worse,"" said government economist Ronald Indergand said, Reuters reported. ""It is going to take years to get over this. The economy is only going to get back to its previous level by 2022.""Earlier Tuesday, government economists forecast a 6.2% fall in GDP in 2020 and for unemployment to average 3.8% over the year as a whole.

Even if it is determined that the new cluster was not triggered by imported meat, the reports may have already hit consumer sentiment. If that triggers a shift in preference for domestic pork, that could drive up food inflation. — Huileng Tan9:55 a.m. (Singapore time) — Singapore is set to lift most restrictions on Friday.

There were no additional deaths. China's total number of reported cases is now 83,221. Beijing had no new confirmed cases for almost two months until an infection was reported on June 12, according to Reuters.The new cluster in Beijing has been linked to a wholesale food market. The city began imposing restrictions again, such as closing schools and sports venues, as well as ordering people to get tested for the coronavirus.The first cases of the virus were first reported in December in China's Wuhan city, also at a seafood market. Cases of Covid-19 have now spread globally, with more than 8 million infections according to Johns Hopkins University data. — Weizhen Tan7 p.m. ET — Taking hydroxychloroquine along with remdesivir may weaken the effectiveness of the latter drug, the Food and Drug Administration warned, citing a recently completed non-clinical study.Remdesivir was granted emergency use authorization by the FDA to treat hospitalized patients sickened with Covid-19 in May. Hydroxychloroquine had also been granted a EUA for the coronavirus, but the designation was revoked earlier in the day after the FDA found it was unlikely to be effective.The news by the FDA of the potential drug interaction is likely to further dampen hopes that hydroxychloroquine is helpful against the coronavirus. —Berkeley Lovelace Jr. 6:20 p.m. ET — JPMorgan Chase is planning to bring more traders back to its headquarters in New York City on June 22, according to someone with knowledge of the bank's plans.Around 20% of the division's staff has worked from offices during the pandemic, but that number could rise to 50% by mid-July, CNBC's Hugh Son reports. JPMorgan will institute safety measures like requiring employees to wear masks in common areas and marking desks with colored stickers to indicate where workers can sit.

Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told NBC News that the donations are a way to make people think of China ""as a leader on the response to the Covid-19 pandemic they caused."" —Alex Harring3:06 p.m. ET — The World Health Organization urged scientists around the world to investigate disease clusters to understand the origin and cause of the coronavirus infection.The comments come after officials in Beijing reported a total of 79 confirmed cases of Covid-19 originating from Xinfadi, the biggest wholesale food market in Asia, since June 11. The market is more than 20 times larger than the seafood market in Wuhan where the coronavirus outbreak was first identified.The WHO said in a statement on Saturday that all confirmed cases are in isolation and under care. Health officials are currently tracking the origin of the new clusters in Beijing and closely monitoring the oubtreak.""The answers lie in careful, systematic, exhaustive investigation of disease clusters to really look at what is happening in these situations and what is causing the amplification of the disease in the human context,"" said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's emergencies program, during a press conference at the agency's Geneva headquarters.""If we get that, we will build up a much better picture of the public health advice we need to give to our communities on what behaviors to avoid, what places to avoid, and what circumstances to avoid,"" he said. —Jasmine Kim2:32 p.m. ET — The Trump administration doesn't want to extend enhanced unemployment benefits past their scheduled July 31 end date, according to White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow.Instead, the administration and congressional Republicans want to replace the $600 a week in extra jobless benefits with a cash bonus that would pay a temporary, smaller weekly sum to Americans who find a new job.Democrats want to extend the $600 payments, arguing that high levels of joblessness will persist past July. —Greg Iacurci1:54 p.m. ET — House Democrats wrote to the chief executives of some of the country's largest banks, including J.P.

They also wrote to the Treasury, demanding a detailed list of everyone that applied and received loans from the program. They chastised both the Treasury and SBA for not making the need to prioritize loans for underserved communities a part of the program's guidance, despite what they say was the original intent of the CARES Act that established the program. —Lauren Hirsch1:28 p.m. ET — San Francisco has moved into Phase 2B of its reopening, joining other Bay Area counties in easing coronavirus restrictions.The city now allows outdoor dining, indoor shopping at retailers, non-emergency medical appointments and small gatherings, including religious services and ceremonies. Professional sports can resume for broadcast, but cannot have in-person spectators. Summer camps can also open in San Francisco. —Hannah Miller1:04 p.m. ET — The Food and Drug Administration announced it is ending its emergency use authorization of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, the drugs backed by President Donald Trump.The move by the agency comes nearly two weeks after a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found hydroxychloroquine was no better than a placebo in preventing infection of the coronavirus.The FDA, in its notice, said the drugs were ""unlikely to be effective"" in treating Covid-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA. The FDA had warned consumers in April against taking the drugs due to the risk of ""serious heart rhythm problems"" in some patients.Even though hydroxychloroquine is not a proven treatment for the coronavirus, some people across the world took it after a handful of small studies published earlier in the year suggested it could be beneficial and Trump promoted the drug as a potential treatment for the virus. —Berkeley Lovelace Jr.12:40 p.m. ET — The number of patients sickened with Covid-19 across Texas' hospitals continues to climb with the state reporting its sixth new daily high in less than a week.Texas was among the first states to relax its statewide stay-at-home order. In the past week, Wednesday was the only day that Texas didn't set a new record for hospitalizations. It's likely to add to scrutiny from some U.S. lawmakers that some states, including Texas, opened businesses too early.On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that states may need to reimplement the strict social distancing measures that were put in place earlier this year if U.S. coronavirus cases rise ""dramatically."" —Berkeley Lovelace Jr.12:22 p.m. ET — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin revealed that he is planning to discuss small business bailout disclosure with members of the Senate.Mnuchin said he and the Senate will speak on a ""bipartisan basis"" about reaching a potential deal that protects the privacy of recipients of small business loans while ensuring proper oversight of the funds.Mnuchin announced the news in a tweet, saying he will be ""having discussions"" with the Senate Small Business Committee ""to strike the appropriate balance for proper oversight"" of the Paycheck Protection Program loans ""and appropriate protection of small business information."" —Yelena Dzhanova10:10 a.m. ET — The Television Academy announced the precursor ceremony to the Primetime Emmy Awards will be held virtually this year as a precaution against the spread of the coronavirus.The event, which had been scheduled to take place on September 12 and 13, awards those behind-the-scenes working in production, design, set decoration, editing, casting and sound.The Governors Ball, the official afterparty for the Emmys, has also been canceled.The Television Academy still plans on hosting the Primetime Emmys on September 20, however it is evaluating safety measures for the ceremony. —Sarah Whitten9:48 a.m. ET — Without ramped up contact tracing and targeted mitigation strategies, U.S. hot spots could ""quickly get out of control,"" former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CNBC.Arizona, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Arkansas and a handful of others have seen an increase in cases in recent weeks. While some attribute the rise in cases to increased testing, hospitalizations, which are not tethered to the availability of testing, has also risen in a number of states.""What these states need to do, what these cities need to do is good contact tracing, not to find every individual who's infected, but to find the sources of infection, the activities that lead to the infection and take targeted mitigation steps,"" Gottlieb said.When reached for comment on Friday, Arizona's Maricopa County Public Health spokeswoman Sonia Singh told CNBC that it adjusts staff for ""contact tracing up or down as needed in response to case count trends."" She added that 90 additional staff are on the way, half of whom have already started.Gottlieb added that Arizona could take responsibility for contact tracing efforts away from the counties and centralize the effort under state leadership. —William FeuerDisclosure: Scott Gottlieb is a CNBC contributor and is a member of the boards of Pfizer and biotech company Illumina.9:42 a.m. ET — From March through May, the restaurant industry lost $120 billion in revenue, according to the National Restaurant Association.The latest sales data from the trade group paint a bleak picture of the industry, which is expected to lose $240 billion by the end of the year. Restaurants across the country are reopening, but capacity limits and new rules to maintain social distancing constrain dining room sales.Three-quarters of restaurant operators say that it's unlikely that their restaurant will be profitable within the next six months.

The blood bank is not testing for Covid-19 itself and said people who believe they may be ill with Covid-19 should not offer to donate until they are symptom-free for 28 days and are feeling well and healthy.Donations given before Monday will not be tested. The organization expects to offer the testing throughout summer months and testing may be extended into the fall. Results will be available around seven to 10 days after donating. —Alex Harring9:19 a.m. ET — Delta Air Lines has received approval from the Shanghai government to resume flights from June 18, according to a Reuters report citing a company spokeswoman. The airline is still waiting for the Civil Aviation Administration of China to decide on how many flights it can resume and when it can do so, Reuters reported. China's aviation authority has said it would allow foreign airlines to increase flights between the country and other regions from June 8. —Melodie Warner, Reuters 8:50 a.m. ET — Germany will launch an app to trace the contacts of coronavirus patients this week, Health Minister Jens Spahn said over the weekend.The country's app is being built with the help of Deutsche Telekom and SAP and relies on privacy-focused technology developed by Apple and Google. Italy's government has also launched an app based on the Apple-Google model, called Immuni.The U.K., on the other hand, says it will launch its own app ""soon,"" but the timing of its launch remains unclear. There has been a rift in Europe over whether to use Apple and Google's ""decentralized"" approach, with Britain, France and Norway opting for a more centralized model. Norway announced on Monday that it was pausing work on its app after its data protection regulator flagged privacy concerns. —Ryan Browne8:01 a.m. ET — Nationwide, about 21,000 people are infected with the coronavirus in the U.S. every day. But that national figure masks regional trends, which indicate that while the virus is slowing in the Northeast and Midwest, it's rising in the South and the West, CNBC's Meg Tirrell reported, citing data from the Covid Tracking Project.While some continue to attribute the rise in cases to increased testing, data on hospitalizations, which is not tethered to the availability of testing, is also on the rise in a number of states, including Arizona, Texas and North Carolina. Some states, such as Florida, do not report hospitalizations. The cities seeing the fastest case-doubling time are Yakima, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Tampa, Florida, Tirrell reported, citing data from investment banking firm Evercore ISI.State officials have responded to the increase of infections in a variety of ways. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has insisted the state's hospitals are well prepared for a surge in patients. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown has paused the state's reopening for seven days while health officials reexamine the data and trends. —Will Feuer7:24 a.m. ET — Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and France have agreed to pay an initial 750 million euros ($843.2 million) for 300 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine against Covid-19, a spokesperson for Italy's health ministry said according to a Reuters report.The countries will have the option to buy a further 100 million doses, the health ministry said, according to the news agency. Italy itself will pay 185 million euros for 75 million doses of the vaccine, which is being developed by Oxford University.AstraZeneca announced on Saturday it had agreed with the four countries to supply up to 400 million doses of the vaccine, with deliveries starting by the end of 2020. The pharmaceutical said it was building a number of supply chains in parallel across the world and is seeking to expand manufacturing capacity further. Total manufacturing capacity currently stands at 2 billion doses, the company said.The vaccine is undergoing phase two and three clinical trials with around 10,000 adult volunteers taking part in the late-stage U.K. trial. In a statement Saturday, AstraZeneca said it ""recognises that the vaccine may not work but is committed to progressing the clinical programme with speed and scaling up manufacturing at risk."" –Holly Ellyatt7:16 a.m. ET — In an effort to restart the country's crucial tourism sector, Greece has reopened its main airports to more international flights, Reuters reported.Visitors from airports deemed high-risk by the European Union's aviation safety agency will be tested for the coronavirus and quarantined for up to 14 days if they test positive, according to Reuters. Passengers from Britain and Turkey face greater restrictions, and passengers from other airports will be randomly tested. Country-wide restrictions on movement imposed in March helped Greece contain the spread of Covid-19 infections to just above 3,000 cases, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.""You can come to Greece, you will have a fantastic experience, you can sit on a veranda with this wonderful view, have your nice Assyrtiko wine, enjoy the beach,"" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said Saturday from the Mediterranean island of Santorini, Reuters reported. ""But we don't want you crowded in a beach bar...

VMware, Fastly and Newmont Mining were substituted for Baxter International, GlaxoSmithKline and Kellogg.Baxter, a medical supplies company, was removed because of its high exposure to voluntary surgeries delayed by the impact of the health crisis on hospitals. GlaxoSmithKline, a drug company that's working on a Covid-19 vaccine, was taken off because the stock is ""not enticing many investors,"" Cramer said. Kellogg, the cereal producing giant, was axed because the stock is lagging and the Cramer index already contains seven other similar plays.As for the new additions, Cramer added VMware, one of his cloud king stocks, because the stock is ""cheap on an earnings basis"" and the prospect that the company could be spun off from Dell. Fastly, a cloud content delivery network whose stock price has increased sevenfold since bottoming in March, is one that in hindsight Cramer wishes he included when he created the index in April. Newmont is a gold company that can provide investors ""more insurance against economic chaos"" as the country continues to deal with fallout from the coronavirus crisis, he said.The biggest winners on Crammer's list – Zoom Video, Spotify, Zscaler, DocuSign, Etsy, The Trade Desk, Livongo Health, Square, Peloton and Cloudflare – are among the top plays in the stay-at-home economy.""As the pandemic flares up again, get ready after the industrial rotation ends. It's time to circle back to the blue-chip Covid stocks that are still way off their highs. That's what offers the best risk-reward,"" he said. ""I love a rotation. They throw out the good, they buy the bad and then they change their mind two days later.""Cramer last updated his coronavirus playbook in late May when investors were growing more convinced that the economy was headed for a V-shape recovery as states eased lockdown orders. The host said then, however, that it was ""too soon to give up on the recession stocks"" as he showed 10 stocks the exit and brought 10 others onto his stock index that was designed to outperform the market through the pandemic.""Since we adjusted the index a little over a month ago, it's rallied 6.4%.

2020-07-28,"Joe Biden unveils racial economic equity plan that calls for investment in minority businesses, workers",0.07211882859204288,"WASHINGTON — Former Vice President Joe Biden unveiled a roadmap of policy proposals Tuesday that are aimed at narrowing the generational wealth gap that persists between White Americans and their Black, Latino, Asian and Native American neighbors.Biden's racial economic equity plan is the fourth plank in the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee's ""Build Back Better"" economic platform. Biden announced the plan at a speech in Wilmington, Delaware. There, Biden drew a sharp contrast between his view of the national reckoning underway on racial justice and the ongoing protests in major cities, and the views of his opponent, President Donald Trump.""Every instinct Trump has is to add fuel to the fire,"" said Biden. ""It's the last thing we need. We need leadership that will calm the waters and lower the temperature. That's how to restore peace in the streets."" Biden's economic equity plan is largely a repackaging of dozens of his existing proposals from across the campaign's platforms, such as his plan to offer a one-time student debt reduction of $10,000 per student and his call for a $15 hourly minimum wage.It also contains a separate section focused on criminal justice reform, which includes Biden's plan to eliminate cash bail and to guarantee that formerly incarcerated people are provided temporary housing upon release from prison. It will take all of these policies working together, he said, to begin to achieve economic equality for people of color.""How do we break the cycle? In good times, communities of color still lag. In bad times, they get hit first and the hardest. And in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back. This is about justice ... it's also about jobs, good-paying jobs. And financial stability, building wealth for families of color and passing it down to their kids.""Here are some of the key proposals in Biden's economic equity plank: Create a new Small Business Opportunity Fund and seed it with $30 billion of Biden's proposed $300 billion domestic innovation funding.Expand the New Markets Tax Credit to $5 billion yearly and make it permanent​.Pass legislation to require the Federal Reserve to report data and trends on racial economic gaps and commit the Fed to a ""real-time"" payment system aimed at eliminating the time it takes for checks to clear. The New Markets Tax Credit program awards tax credits to investors who provide capital for community development entities, which finance projects in qualified low-income communities. Created by Congress in 2000, the NMTC has supported more than 5,300 projects in the past two decades, but it is scheduled to expire at the end of this year.Unlike the previous three planks in Biden's economic platform, the racial equity plan does not initially include demands for more federal spending. Instead, it is centered on the ways that funding Biden has already proposed in his first three planks is allocated. Speaking to reporters Tuesday morning, senior Biden campaign advisors said more details about the costs and the funding of these proposals are forthcoming, although they did not specify when to expect the numbers. One thing the plan does not contain is any reference to the word ""reparations,"" despite a growing movement on the left in recent years to quantify and compensate Black Americans for centuries of slave labor and for the subsequent Jim Crow laws that denied them access to the same opportunities to build wealth that White families were given.Grouping all of these policy proposals together under the umbrella of racial economic equity is one way for Biden's campaign to codify the former vice president's commitment to addressing the deep-seated racial injustice that has sparked massive civil unrest across the country this summer. Biden said his plan is ""about rising to this moment of crisis. Understanding people's struggles, and building a future worthy of their courage and their ambition to overcome.""Read the entire plan below."
2020-07-30,"U.S. lawmakers agree Big Tech has too much power, but what to do about it remains a mystery",0.11268097023251662,"Yesterday's Big Tech Congressional hearing featured something that's exceedingly rare in Washington: bipartisan agreement. Sure, there was the expected grandstanding about hypothetical conservative bias, and weird questions about emails going into spam folders and when HBO Max would be on Amazon Fire TV. But there was also a strikingly consistent belief among the 15 members of the U.S. House of Representatives' Antitrust Subcommittee that Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google have too much power.Both Republican and Democratic Congressmen laid out instances where companies have stifled competition, including Amazon using data from third-party sellers against them and Facebook's internal discussions about how buying startups Instagram and WhatsApp could choke off eventual threats. While the CEOs ""respectfully disagreed"" with many characterizations, years of deflection around touchy issues may have undermined their overall credibility with both lawmakers and the public. So Congress thinks there's a real problem here. But we didn't learn anything about what they plan to do about it. And that's probably because the members simply don't know. It's likely all four companies will be highly scrutinized for any market pivots or strategic acquisitions moving forward. But scrutiny doesn't equal action. This isn't a new American problem. It's easy to diagnose problems: Rising health care costs, growing inequality, electoral college unfairness, and so on. Doing something about them takes bold leadership and, sometimes, fumbling legislation. It would have been nice to hear some ideas about how the companies would respond to potential legislative or regulatory solutions, such as spin-outs of divisions (Google and YouTube, Facebook and Instagram), restrictions on future strategic acquisitions, or laws around Apple's App Store policies. There's not going to be a one-size-fits-all legislative or regulatory fix for the four companies. Each company has its own dominance issues, making it unfeasible to create a single broad law that applies to all of them. But it was notable that representatives both sides of the aisle basically came to the same conclusion.House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.: ""There is growing evidence that a handful of corporations have come to capture an outsized share of online commerce and communications.""House Judiciary Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee Chair David Cicilline, D-R.I.: ""Many of the practices used by these companies have harmful economic effects. They discourage entrepreneurship, destroy jobs, hike costs, and degrade quality. Simply put: They have too much power.""Ranking member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.: ""Since the tech investigation began, we have heard rumblings from many who are quick to say your successful companies have grown too large. Since this hearing was announced, it seems that those complaints have gotten even louder....As the business landscape evolves, we must ensure that our existing antitrust laws are applied to meet the needs of our country and its consumers. I share the concern that market dominance in the digital space is ripe for abuse.""This type of basic agreement -- even at the lowest levels of ""there seems to be a problem here"" -- is increasingly rare in high-profile Congressional hearings, which often degrade into political showcases where Democrats take one side and Republicans argue the opposite. While Sensenbrenner did note that bigger companies aren't necessarily problematic, there were few, if any, comments echoing what Morgan Stanley Vice Chairman Robert Kindler told CNBC earlier this week:""I think companies like Amazon have been absolutely terrific for the economy and for the consumer,"" Kindler said. ""What would we have done during this pandemic if we didn't have companies like Amazon? I just can't imagine that people don't think that these are fantastic things that all of these huge companies have brought.""Even if Congress can't figure out the next steps, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google may have to approach future acquisitions very carefully to avoid regulatory pushback. Even small deals could be at risk to be blocked, especially in a Democratic administration, given the committee's attention to CEO Mark Zuckerberg's emails about how buying Instagram could stifle future competition. Facebook only paid $1 billion for Instagram -- peanuts from today's perspective, where Facebook has a $662 billion market valuation and earned more than $18 billion in profit last year. While Facebook was much smaller in 2012, the committee highlighted several instances of Zuckerberg saying in emails that it was easy to acquire startups, suggesting Facebook could use its market power to throw cash at entrepreneurs who may be tempted by big payouts.Indeed, a revealing back-and-forth between Zuckerberg and Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom highlights this point. Systrom tells Zuckerberg that ""I'm not coming back at you to change the offer (then $500 million) because I don't think that's what drives us. Of course there's a limit to that logic."" Sure enough, Zuckerberg raised the offer to $1 billion and Systrom sold. Further, Systrom told Zuckerberg he had concerns about Facebook limiting his independence to run Instagram as he pleased. Zuckerberg responded, ""You reference flexibility and things you'd like to do independently that you couldn't do at Facebook. I'm curious what you think you couldn't do at Facebook, given that what I offered was for you to keep building out Instagram as a separate product and brand. I actually think you'll be able to do all the same things with Instagram at Facebook."" Six years later, Systrom left Facebook after butting heads with Zuckerberg over how he was integrating Instagram with Facebook. Even if you take Zuckerberg at his word at the time that he had no plans to mess with the company's operations, he knew in the back of his mind that, ultimately, he was the boss. This is true for any acquisition. But with Apple, Google and Amazon all over $1 trillion in market capitalization and Facebook near $700 billion, the ability of these companies to throw money and equity at startups is unrivaled and nearly risk-free when purchase prices are so relatively small.While Kindler may be correct that consumers have benefited from the immense growth of big technology,  a continual stream of start-ups merging into four or five big companies may not only limit technological innovation but also thought innovation. If the same leaders are controlling companies, the same ways of thinking will continue to dictate corporate policy. That's a bipartisan concern. And, in this political environment, that's a rarity. WATCH: Former DOJ antitrust chief: Google, Amazon face the biggest antitrust threat"
2020-08-03,The gadgets and software that could help us return to the office,0.10074403963784495,"As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads.

Crowd sizes for those protests were not immediately reported, but Ales Bialiatski, head of the Viasna human rights organization, said the demonstration in Minsk attracted more than 100,000 people.The protests, unprecedented in Belarus for their size and duration, began after the Aug. 9 presidential vote that election officials said gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office with 80% support. Protesters say the results were rigged, and some have explained to Associated Press journalists exactly how the fraud took place in their districts.Lukashenko has ruled the country with an iron fist since 1994, regularly repressing dissent and press freedom.Police violently cracked down on demonstrators in the first days of the protests, arresting some 7,000 people and beating hundreds. Although they have scaled back, detentions continue; Viasna reported scores of people were arrested in Minsk and in the city of Grodno on Sunday.Police and army troops blocked off the center of Minsk on Sunday, but demonstrators marched to the outskirts of the Palace of Independence, the president's working residence 3 kilometers (2 miles) outside the city center. The palace grounds were blocked off by phalanxes of shield-bearing riot police and water cannon.""This sea of ​​people cannot be stopped by military equipment, water cannons, propaganda and arrests. Most Belarusians want a peaceful change of power and we will not get tired of demanding this,"" said Maria Kolesnikova, a leader of the Coordination Council set up by the opposition to try to arrange a dialogue with the 66-year-old Lukashenko about a transition of power.She spoke with The Associated Press by telephone.Lukashenko has rejected any discussion with the council and some of its top members have been jailed. One of them, Olga Kovalova, was expelled from the country over the weekend, driven to Poland by police.Despite the stalemate between Lukashenko and the opposition, protesters say they are determined not to tire. Some of the placards they carried Sunday showed a lively sense of humor.""Lukashenka, start building a house near Yanukovych,"" read one, referring to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych who fled to Russia in 2014 after months of anti-government protests.""The collective farm went bankrupt,"" said another, evoking Lukashenko's former position as a collective farm director and his retention of largely state-controlled Soviet-style economy for Belarus, an Eastern European nation of 9.5 million.Authorities also have revoked the accreditation of many Belarusian journalists and deported some foreign journalists, including two Moscow-based Associated Press journalists. AP's Belarusian journalists were among those told their press credentials had been revoked."
2020-09-16,Biden ramps up Latino outreach with appeal to Puerto Rican voters in Florida,0.08235612426788898,"WASHINGTON – Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden visited South Florida on Tuesday, seeking to shore up support among Hispanic voters in this crucial swing state.Biden's trip came after a poll of Florida voters was released last week that sent shockwaves through the Democratic Party. The poll, by NBC News and Marist, found President Donald Trump leading Biden among Latino voters by four points, 50-46.Four years ago, Democrat Hillary Clinton won Hispanic voters in Florida by 25 points, 60-35, although she lost the state overall. According to the NBC poll, Biden is underperforming Clinton by 29 points with a key demographic in a key state.Historically, Republicans tend to do better with Hispanic voters in Florida than they do elsewhere, owing to the state's large concentration of Cuban Americans who lean Republican.Nonetheless, the NBC survey results coming just 50 days before Election Day set off alarm bells at the Biden campaign.On Saturday, the Biden campaign unveiled a trio of new Spanish-language ads that will run in Florida, each one directed at a specific group of Hispanic voters.On Sunday, aides to billionaire Michael Bloomberg announced that the former Democratic primary candidate will spend $100 million to support Biden in Florida, essentially freeing up the campaign to put money allocated for Florida into other battleground states such as Pennsylvania.Tuesday night was Biden's first major speech aimed directly at Hispanic voters in Florida. But not just any Hispanic voters: Puerto Rican voters.The former vice president delivered his speech at a Hispanic Heritage month celebration in Kissimmee. While there were no crowds, the location reflected his campaign's effort to court Puerto Rican voters. Kissimmee is the seat of Osceola County, the only county in America where Puerto Ricans outnumber all other ancestral groups. Before he took the stage, Biden was introduced by two world-famous Puerto Rican performers, Ricky Martin and Luis Fonsi, and by Hispanic American actress and activist Eva Longoria. In prepared remarks, the former vice president ripped Trump's approach to the U.S. territory. ""Even after being president for four years, Donald Trump does not seem to grasp that the people of Puerto Rico are American citizens already,"" he said.""I'm running to be president of all Americans, including 3 million American citizens living in Puerto Rico. I'm not going to steal the money that is desperately needed to reconstruct the island, in order to build a wall that does nothing to keep Americans safe. I'm not going to suggest that we sell or trade Puerto Rico. I'm not going to throw paper towels whose lives have been devastated by the hurricane,"" said Biden. Last fall, Trump shifted $300 million away from cash-strapped disaster relief agencies to fund border security projects, including his ""wall"" project on the southern border. In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017, Trump allegedly wondered aloud whether the United States could ""sell"" the island or ""divest"" from it. And during a rare visit to Puerto Rico shortly after the hurricanes, Trump tossed rolls of paper towels into a crowd of survivors at a relief center. Biden also said Tuesday that while he personally supports adding Puerto Rico as a state, he will work with both sides of what is a bitter debate on the island, and let voters there ultimately decide their course. Along with Biden's visit, the campaign released a multi-pronged plan Tuesday afternoon to help rebuild and revitalize Puerto Rico, which is home to 3 million American citizens. Two devastating hurricanes in 2017 left millions of Puerto Ricans without power for months, prompting more than one hundred thousand to move to the mainland.Today, Florida is home to more than a million people who identify as Puerto Rican. Nationwide, Puerto Ricans represent the second largest pool of Hispanic voters in the country, after Mexican Americans. In Florida, more than one in four Latino voters identifies as Puerto Rican. Key elements of Biden's Puerto Rico plan: - Provide direct federal investment in infrastructure projects and forgive federal disaster aid - Offer Puerto Ricans more access to community-based health care and SNAP food assistance - Ease Puerto Rico's massive debt burden by reversing austerity measures and restructuring some of the debtIn a statement accompanying the new plan, the Biden campaign criticized Trump's response to the 2017 hurricanes in Puerto Rico. They also brought up the account of Elaine Duke, a former top official at the Department of Homeland Security. Earlier this year Duke told The New York Times that in the aftermath of the Hurricane Maria, Trump mused about whether the United States could sell Puerto Rico.Taken together, Biden's plan for Puerto Rico and his direct appeal on Tuesday to Puerto Rican voters represent the best example so far of what the Biden campaign says is an ultra-targeted strategy with Hispanic voters. In response to the concerns raised by the NBC poll last week, Biden campaign aides over the weekend emphasized that their outreach to Hispanic voters has expanded dramatically in recent weeks, and now includes full-time Hispanic-focused mobilization efforts in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, New Mexico, Nevada and Texas.""The pathway to victory includes winning key battleground states and we're going to do that by building a culturally competent campaign that targets states with heavy Hispanic populations,"" senior political adviser Jorge Neri said on a conference call with reporters Sunday.Biden aides also stressed how carefully targeted their Spanish language outreach is, up to and including using different Spanish accents in multiple versions of each campaign ad, accents that are tailored to the geographic origins of the Hispanic population in different markets.Below is one of the Spanish language ads Biden launched over the weekend.Currently, Biden ads appearing in the Miami and Tampa media markets are voiced with Cuban-accented Spanish. In and around Orlando, voters hear a Puerto Rican accent. And in West Palm, Fort Myers, and across Arizona, the narrator has a Mexican accent.""That is indispensable because we know that our communities, we share a language, but we have a tremendous diversity of experiences and from those experiences we have similar priorities, but we also have many unique interests,"" Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez told reporters. It's impossible to tell at this stage whether Biden's play for Puerto Rican voters will bear fruit. But already this week there are signs that perhaps the NBC/Marist poll was merely an outlier, and that Biden is actually doing better with Latino voters in Florida than it seemed he was last week.On Tuesday, Monmouth University released a new poll of Florida that showed Biden winning Latino voters 58 to 32 over Trump, a number that's much closer to Clinton's 2016 margin."
2020-09-17,"Biden's national polling lead shrinks slightly, but swing states show signs of trouble for Trump",0.014714013844448634,"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is still leading President Donald Trump in the polls, though averages of national surveys show a trend toward a slightly tightening race with less than seven weeks until Election Day. But Biden continues to hold his edge over the incumbent in a handful of crucial swing states, including some that Trump won in 2016.The RealClearPolitics general election polling average on Thursday morning showed Biden with a 5.8-point lead over Trump. That spread has shrunk from the 7.2-point lead RCP displayed for Biden just two weeks earlier. FiveThirtyEight's own polling tracker, which on Sept. 3 had Biden 7.3 points above Trump, now gives the Democratic challenger a 6.7-point advantage.Individual polls of the race for the White House show a much wider variance. National surveys released this week from The Economist/YouGov and Reuters/Ipsos both put Biden up 9 points on Trump among likely voters. But Rasmussen — the president's favorite pollster, which has consistently found higher levels of support for him than other outfits — on Wednesday gave Trump his first-ever polling lead over Biden, by 1 point, which falls within its margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.But national polls are only part of the story, as any number of anxious Democratic voters will be quick to point out. In 2016, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton trounced Trump in the popular vote by more than 2.8 million votes, but still lost the Electoral College.That race came down to a series of upset victories by Trump in key swing states, including Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida. Trump walked away with 306 electoral votes to Clinton's 232.RCP's swing-state tracker, however, shows Biden leading to varying degrees in all of those battleground states, as well as in North Carolina and Arizona, which Trump also won in 2016.That polling tracker now gives Biden an overall spread of 3.7 points over Trump — a wider lead than it showed at the start of the month.That shift appears to be driven by recent surveys of voters in Wisconsin and Arizona, both of which show Biden furthering his gains over Trump since the end of August.In Arizona, RCP shows Biden with a 4.7-point lead over Trump, who in 2016 beat Clinton in the Grand Canyon State by about 3.5 percentage points.The Trump campaign appears to be taking notice, announcing Thursday that it would air a new ad, featuring a business owner praising the president and attacking Biden's record, specifically in Arizona.Still, the race in Arizona remains tight, according to a survey of the state released Thursday morning by the Monmouth University Polling Institute. While Biden in that poll holds a 4-point lead among all registered voters in the state, 48%-44%, the gap shrinks to just 2 percentage points under a model of likely voters with high turnout, with Biden at 48% and Trump at 46%. In a low-turnout model, Monmouth finds Trump and Biden tied at 47% among likely voters.Monmouth surveyed 420 registered voters in Arizona by phone between Friday and Tuesday. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.Cook Political Report, meanwhile, moved Arizona's election rating from ""Toss Up"" to ""Lean Democrat"" earlier Thursday morning, citing in part Biden's support among Latinos in the state. The same can't be said for Florida, where recent polls showed Biden underperforming among Latinos.The Biden campaign has reacted quickly. The former vice president himself visited South Florida on Tuesday, and his campaign over the weekend announced new ads in the state targeting different groups of Hispanic voters.The shifting polls come as the economy, health care and the coronavirus pandemic take center stage in the campaign messaging for both Trump and Biden.More than 6.63 million Covid-19 cases and at least 196,831 deaths from the disease have been reported in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University. Trump, eager to recover the devastating economic losses from the pandemic before the election, has proclaimed that his administration has done a ""great job"" on the crisis and has repeatedly floated the possibility of a vaccine being developed and distributed before Election Day. His own health experts, however, have suggested the timeline would be much slower.Biden, meanwhile, describes the U.S. response as being tragically mishandled.The president in recent weeks has also weathered a series of potentially damaging news stories related to the coronavirus, including revelations from veteran journalist Bob Woodward that Trump admitted downplaying the dangers of the virus.The polling averages, however, don't reflect any dramatic change following these reports, offering further evidence for the view among political watchers that Trump's core base of support is simply unshakable.But that's a blessing and a curse, analyst Charlie Cook noted last week:""There is nothing that could be said or written, nothing that Trump can say or do, that would crack his base. Those expecting Trump to drop at the next negative story forget that it is hard to take a drop if you've never risen in the first place,"" Cook wrote.""But this is also why those who are convinced that he will make a spectacular comeback are likely to be wrong as well. His standing is impervious to events."""
2020-09-29,Oil slides more than 3% as virus cases mount,-0.07061237373737372,"Oil prices on Tuesday fell more than 3%, although closed off their lowest levels of the day, on worries about the outlook for fuel demand as Europe and the United States grappled with a surge in new coronavirus infections.Stock and commodities investors remained cautious ahead of the first U.S. presidential debate between Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump later on Tuesday.The energy market was also waiting for weekly updates on U.S. crude stockpiles from the American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday.Analysts polled by Reuters forecast U.S. crude inventories increased 1.6 million barrels last week.On its second to last day as the front-month, Brent futures for November delivery fell $1.60, or 3.8%, to $40.83 a barrel, while the more active Brent contract for December fell 3.6% to $41.33.West Texas Intermediate crude fell $1.31, or 3.2%, to settle at $39.29 per barrel.More than a million people worldwide have died from COVID-19, according to a Reuters tally, a bleak milestone in a pandemic that has devastated the global economy and demand for fuel.New York City will impose fines on people who refuse to wear a face covering as the rate of positive coronavirus tests climbed above 3% for the first time in months, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Tuesday.""The evolving COVID landscape is a massive downside risk for crude prices,"" said Craig Erlam, senior analyst at OANDA.The heads of the world's largest trading houses predicted tepid oil demand recovery and flat prices in the coming months and possibly even years.Clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region have also kept markets on edge. If the conflict escalates, it could affect oil and gas exports from Azerbaijan.In Libya, meanwhile, the Sarir oilfield has restarted production, the head of the company that operates it said on Tuesday, after eastern forces lifted an eight-month blockade on energy facilities."
2020-09-29,VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger says a Dell spinoff could give him freedom to work with more manufacturers,0.18600566100566102,"VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger said that if majority owner Dell follows through with a spinoff of his company, it would provide him with greater flexibility to team up with other hardware makers.Speaking to CNBC ahead of this week's virtual VMworld conference, Gelsinger said VMware's server virtualization software could start to ""show up with HP"" if that's what customers want.""The ecosystem would look favorably on a more independent VMware,"" Gelsinger said. VMware shares have dropped this year, underperforming tech stocks and the broader market, as the coronavirus pandemic has pushed more businesses to the cloud and away from physical data centers.Dell, which acquired its 80% stake in VMware through the 2016 acquisition of data storage maker EMC, said in July that it was exploring a VMware spinoff to Dell shareholders, in part to enhance ""strategic flexibility."" Any deal wouldn't happen before September 2021, Dell said.In addition to greater partnership opportunities, operating independently could make VMware a more attractive destination for top talent and give the company more freedom to do deals, Gelsinger said.""I can't effectively use my equity for acquisitions today,"" he said. ""There's a very tight ownership range I have to live inside of.""That's not to say VMware has shied away from dealmaking. Since becoming CEO in 2012, Gelsinger has completed more than 40 acquisitions, including Carbon Black, CloudHealth and VeloCloud, helping bolster VMware's subscription software business. He also led a partnership with Amazon Web Services in 2016, so customers could use a combination of cloud and on-premises services for their workloads.After the coronavirus pandemic forced companies to close their offices, some VMware customers became more reliant on cloud services from AWS. That theme has played out across the cloud infrastructure landscape. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in April that ""we have seen two years' worth of digital transformation in two months,"" referring to sales, customers service and security all moving into ""a world of remote everything.""VMware's license revenue dropped 7% in the quarter that ended July 31, compared with 2% growth in the prior quarter. The company's cloud and subscription unit grew 44%. Gelsinger said some companies are heading in the other direction with their infrastructure, because cloud costs can get hefty. Comcast, he said, had about half its capacity in the cloud and the other half in traditional data centers and is increasing the portion of on-premises work to 70%.That split ""gives them a much better economic model,"" Gelsinger said.There are also laws in various countries that prevent some applications from being hosted in the cloud, and there are other instances where data doesn't need to move over the internet so it's better served on-premises. VMware is still investing in its traditional business. On Tuesday, it announced that it is working with chipmaker Nvidia to make it easier for customers to run artificial intelligence workloads using VMware's vSphere server-management software.As the company heads toward a possible ownership change, Gelsinger said investors are looking for leadership continuity.""I'm a very happy CEO these days, and I don't expect that to change,"" Gelsinger said.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.WATCH: VMware CEO Patrick Gelsinger on its second-quarter results"
2020-10-02,"Number of mortgages in coronavirus bailout program jumps 21,000 after declining for six straight weeks",-0.01569023569023569,"The number of mortgages in active pandemic-related bailout plans rose by 21,000 in the past week after declining for six straight weeks, according to Black Knight, a mortgage technology and analytics firm. The increase was not across all mortgage types but among bank-held and private-labeled security loans (28,000), and, to a lesser extent, among FHA/VA loans (2,000). Those increases were offset by a decline of 9,000 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in forbearance.The government and private sector forbearance programs, initiated at the start of the pandemic, allow borrowers to delay their monthly payments for at least three months and for up to a year. Forbearance is granted in three-month terms, and so far more than 75% of borrowers in bailouts are on extensions since March.""As of the 29th [of September], nearly 800,000 forbearance plans were still set to expire in September, down from 2 million at the start of the month. The data is still coming in, but over the past week, we've seen a roughly 80% extension rate,"" said Andy Walden, director of market research at Black Knight. ""Given that there are another million plans for which October marks the last payment covered by forbearance, we should expect to see heightened levels of expiration/extension activity in the coming weeks.""As of Tuesday, roughly 3.6 million homeowners remain in pandemic-related forbearance plans. That's 6.8% of all active mortgages, representing $751 billion in unpaid principal.While the weekly turn is troubling, over the past month active forbearance volumes have fallen by 305,000, or 8%. FHA and VA loans, which generally go to borrowers with lower incomes and lower down payments, are not recovering as well as the rest of the market. It is likely those borrowers are in jobs that have been hardest hit by the pandemic.It is impossible to know specifically why more borrowers suddenly needed help on their mortgages, but it is a sign that all is not improving in the housing market. Some borrowers have been dipping into savings to make their monthly payments, and that may have now run dry. While the economy is adding jobs again, the unemployment rate is still high, and some borrowers are still clearly struggling. By loan type, 4.7% of all Fannie and Freddie-backed loans are in forbearance, while 11.2% of all FHA/VA loans are. For private label and bank-held loans, that share is 7.3%."
2020-10-30,Most important 2020 election misinformation threat is not coming from overseas: Facebook former security chief Alex Stamos,0.1333695982380193,"As 2020 Election Day nears, technology companies like Facebook are doing a better job than they did in 2016 in fighting the social media misinformation campaigns of foreign adversaries like Russia and Iran, according to Alex Stamos. He should know — Stamos was a former security chief for the world's largest social media platform.But the cybersecurity expert, who now is director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, says the toughest misinformation threat technology companies face, and can't solve, is from within the U.S. — disinformation sowed by U.S. politicians, and one figure, in particular.""What's changed in 2020 versus 2016 is the massive amount of cooperation between large and small technology platforms and the government. In 2016, it was really no one's job to think about how Russia or others might use online to cause chaos in the election,"" Stamos said at the CNBC Technology Executive Council virtual summit on Thursday.""Now there is a dedicated group between the government and tech and massive takedowns of Russian assets and also Iran. A huge difference,"" he said.Stamos also pointed to efforts like the election integrity site EI Partnership, with which he works. But making sure voters get the elections information they need to make informed decisions is being made harder by the threat from within our own borders.""The most important disinformation this cycle is coming from domestic sources, and that is huge problem for technology companies,"" Stamos said. ""They are loathe to wade into democratic processes in the U.S.""""It's wonderful tech companies have war rooms and counter disinformation efforts, but we also need to see leadership from the federal government, but we're seeing the federal government sowing misinformation, spreading misinformation, and it's very significant in terms of causing nervousness and lack of confidence in the voting process,"" said Alexis Wichowski, Deputy CTO for Innovation, New York City Mayor's Office of the CTO, who spoke on the CNBC TEC virtual summit with Stamos.The former Facebook security chief said the collaboration between tech platforms and units within the federal government, such as the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which didn't exist in 2016, as well as offensive operations from the military's Cyber Command, are working against the foreign disinformation.""But at the same time, there is election disinformation out of the White House, out of the Twitter account of the president himself and then also from theses influencers around him trying to amplify election disinformation,"" Stamos said. ""I'm not sure we have a good solution between now and Election Day.""He used an early claim of victory in the president election as an example of why censorship won't work.Claims made online can be labeled or taken down, but if President Trump goes to a White House podium and declares victory, it will be covered by every major news organization.""There is only so much they can do if the president gets on a podium of the White House. ... that is newsworthy and will be run on TV and everywhere and they can't censor it.""This week, the top executives from the biggest tech companies including Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet, were grilled by Senate Republicans over claims of bias.President Trump has railed against technology companies and signed an executive order last May targeting Twitter and others after the social media company fact-checked some of his tweeted claims, which he called ""censorship.""The Senate hearing was focused on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and threats to alter the Act as a response to social media company actions. Facebook and Twitter recently limited access to a New York Post story claiming corrupt actions involving Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, which Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey later said was the wrong move.""Section 230 is one of the most understood laws about the internet and cited by everyone as too important, and cause of lots of behavior. But the truth is the vast majority of stuff people don't like online is protected under the First Amendment,"" Stamos said.What technology companies can do, Stamos said, is add context, like news organizations would, and he said that makes more sense than trying to block claims entirely.In the end, Stamos said individuals need to make sure they are very careful about what they look at, and where they get information online, and rely on state and local election officials and authorities, of which there are roughly 8,000 in the U.S., and get information on voting directly from them.They may even turn to non-traditional sources of information online, and given the situation, Wichowski said that is a reasonable option. ""In the absence of leadership from the White House or confusing leadership messaging from all levels of government, people look to whomever they can trust,"" Wichowski said.That can even include celebrities and social media influencers, she added, ""if they don't trust elected officials. ... can't just rely on traditional sources of power.""The New York City technology officer said one thing citizens should not worry about is the processing of ballots. ""From an election perspective, decentralization is a strength. It may take more time to process ballots, but we want to protect system integrity from outside actors and each region and district have a solid handle on their own slice of the pie, and decentralization is the way to go about it.""Stamos said after Election Day, one major issue a new Congress should take up is how to structure more federal support for local agencies to make sure disinformation is not promulgated by politicians."
2020-11-12,JD.com wants a network of 5 million stores as e-commerce battle heats up ,0.20079734219269102,"Chinese retailer JD.com plans to aggressively expand its brick-and-mortar reach— aiming for a network of 5 million physical stores in the next 3 years — as China's e-commerce companies sharpen their competition for consumers in smaller Chinese cities.Xu Lei, chief executive of JD Retail, said the company is ""aware that China's retail market is huge."" But he added that JD's business model can have limitations and he therefore wants to ""build offline stores on our own and partner with existing players.""The company's online model ""can only service certain number of consumers. We want to apply our years of experience, including logistics, merchandising and technology to a much wider context,"" Xu told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal. ""Therefore, last year, we determined to position JD as an all-channel retail platform.""""In addition to our centralized online app, we also have a lot of de-centralized offline platforms. The offline market is very important to us,"" Xu said, speaking to CNBC as part of the annual East Tech West conference, which is being held this year both remotely and in Guangzhou, China.As part of the strategy to build its retail presence, JD opened its biggest physical store, called the JD E-Space, on Singles Day in Chongqing in November last year. But the company does not plan to build 5 million stores itself.""What's more important is to make good use of our partner stores,"" Xu said. ""So far we have linked up with over 2-and-a-half million stores, including our own stores. In three years, our projection is to have a network linking up to five million stores.""This year JD put $100 million of backing into appliance store operator Gome Retail Holding — one of China's largest appliance chains. The joint venture lets customers examine items at Gome's roughly 2,600 stores and then purchase the products through JD.com.JD's moves underline the fierce competition among China's leading e-commerce retailers to get more consumers in the country's smaller cities. Alibaba – JD's biggest rival — recently acquired a 19.9% stake in Suning.com, with the intention of boosting its market share in China's smaller cities.Small cities are important not only for internet-based merchants, but also traditional retailers across China, which is the world's second-biggest economy. ""What happens to consumers from fourth- to sixth-tier cities, when they want to buy some big-branded products, they either find out that the products are not available locally or they are sold at a much higher price than those in the upper-tier cities,"" said Xu. ""JD is providing consumers in lower-tier markets the same kind access to products and pricing through our nation-wide logistics network. ""Going forward, the company intends to work with popular brands to tailor products from region to region.""Many brands have come to realize the huge size of the Chinese market, so they customize products for lower-tier cities by leveraging JD's data and our supply chain capabilities,"" he said. ""They have had great results. We've seen sales orders from lower-tier markets growing by over 100% so far this year.""— CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report."

2020-12-04,U.S. Foreign Service group blasts State Department's plans for large indoor holiday events during Covid surge,0.08713660413660414,"As Covid-19 surges across the country, the American Foreign Service Association on Friday criticized large indoor holiday events scheduled at the U.S. State Department.AFSA, whose members include active-duty and retired Foreign Service officers and specialists at the State Department and other federal agencies, said in a statement that it is ""very concerned to see reports of plans to host holiday parties with hundreds of invitees at the Department of State.""Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other State Department officials have planned several indoor holiday parties, including one with at least 900 guests invited, The Washington Post reported.The scheduled events fly in the face of a Nov. 25 notice from State Department leadership that instructed employees to avoid hosting non-mission critical events in person and ""opt for virtual events,"" NBC News reported.""We urge the Department to reverse course and model responsible behavior in accordance with its own guidelines,"" AFSA said.""We've taken every precaution to thin out the number of individuals in all spaces at one time, and plan to keep outdoors space open and available to attendees, weather permitting,"" a State Department spokesperson said in an email in response to AFSA's statement, adding that the department plans to follow health precautions including requiring masks, social distancing and temperature checks.The spokesperson did not provide guidance on how the State Department will enforce mask-wearing while food and beverages are provided at the events.The Centers for Disease Control cautions against indoor gatherings, which it says poses more risk of coronavirus spread than outdoor gatherings.The White House also plans to host at least 20 indoor holiday parties, according to NBC News, including one held Tuesday night featuring an appearance from President Donald Trump. Pictures from the event show several attendees not wearing masks.Several White House events, including the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett and an election night celebration, have resulted in dozens of coronavirus cases. In all, at least 45 people connected to the White House, including Trump, first lady Melania Trump and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows have tested positive for the virus.When asked during a press conference Wednesday whether the White House is setting a good example for Americans by hosting in-person holiday parties, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said, ""You can celebrate the holiday of Christmas, and you can do it responsibly...We will engage in the celebration of Christmas."" McEnany tested positive for Covid-19 in October.A report from the White House's own coronavirus task force obtained by NBC News on Wednesday warned ""the COVID risk to all Americans is at a historic high.""The report urged Americans to avoid social gatherings and said, ""It must be made clear that if you are over 65 or have significant health conditions, you should not enter any indoor public spaces where anyone is unmasked due to the immediate risk to your health.""The U.S. reported a record number of daily new Covid-19 cases, current hospitalizations and single-day deaths on Thursday, indicating that the national virus crisis is only accelerating."
2020-12-10,Here's a first look at Apple's $549 AirPods Max headphones,0.275557289031315,"Apple sent me a pair of its new AirPods Max headphones to check out ahead of their release on Dec. 15. The $549 price tag shocked a lot of people when Apple unveiled them earlier this week. And, yeah, that's a lot of money. But they sure are nice.Apple dominates the Bluetooth headphone business, with more than a 50% share of the market, according to Strategy Analytics. That's thanks to the huge success of the original AirPods and AirPods Pro. With the AirPods Max, Apple built a luxury pair of headphones that borrows some of the features from the AirPods Pro but with larger speakers and more premium materials like steel and aluminum and better sound.The AirPods Max kind of remind me of the original HomePod. It's one of the best sounding smart speakers on the market, but it also costs several times more than competitors from Amazon and Google. Apple may not sell millions and millions of the AirPods Max the way it does the AirPods, but it doesn't need to. I think these are really just a top-tier option for people who want the best headphones Apple makes. Sort of like how Apple sells a $5,999 Mac Pro for people who want the best Mac Apple makes.Here's a look at the AirPods Max:This case serves a purpose, though. It has magnets inside so that when you put the AirPods Max in it they automatically go into low power mode to help save battery life. I agree with the critics. It looks a little weird.I wore the AirPods Max for several hours Wednesday and they felt super comfortable. There's a breathable mesh band on the top that felt light on my head and didn't get sweaty or hot. I also love the ear cups, which are spacious and fit around my ears instead of sitting on them.There are a lot of high-end touches, like aluminum cups and a steel frame, instead of plastic parts you might find in competing headsets. I also dig the Digital Crown that Apple brought over from the Apple Watch. It feels solid and turns easily to adjust the volume. A lot of competing high-end headphones use touch controls for volume, which isn't as accurate as a physical control.The AirPods Max are just as easy as other AirPods to set up. That's important, since it's one of the reasons the AirPods are so successful. You just turn the AirPods Max on, bring your iPhone or iPad nearby, and tap a pop-up that says ""connect."" That's it. There's no need to poke through your Bluetooth settings for the connection.I like that it's easy to switch between an iPhone, Mac or iPad, too. But, they don't have a 3.5 mm headphone jack so you'll need to buy an adapter and a cord if you want to use them with non-Bluetooth devices.You don't need an Apple gadget to use the AirPods Max. They'll connect to Android phones, Windows PCs and other devices like any other Bluetooth headset.They sound really good to me. I'll revisit more in my full review, but I also don't know that I could stand here right now and pinpoint exactly how much better they sound than a pair of Bose or Sony headphones. The noise cancellation is pretty solid: I didn't hear people talking in the room next to me while I was working. I'm not sure how they'll compare on an airplane to Bose yet, though. And I won't be flying anytime soon for obvious reasons.Apple has a few tricks competitors don't have, like Spatial Audio, which makes it sound like noises in a movie are coming from all around you and from the source, like your iPad or iPhone. It's a cool feature Apple recently added to the AirPods Pro.There are lots of sensors, so the headphones pause audio when you take them off, or even when you lift an earcup. That works well.Finally, I tested the microphones with a quick 10-minute call Wednesday. It seemed like the other side heard me just fine, and I could hear them perfectly.The AirPods Max are also pretty big. One of the reasons I love the AirPods Pro so much is that, back when we could travel, I was able to leave my Bose headphones at home and use the noise cancellation in the much smaller earbuds. They just slip in my pocket and I can carry them with me wherever I go. The AirPods Max don't have that convenience. They're still big enough that you'll need a bag to carry them around. But they're perfect at home right now when I'm mostly sitting at my computer most of the day.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."

2020-12-30,"With bitcoin ticking over $28,000, now might be a good time to give some of it to charity",0.2354182582123758,"Sitting on a growing bitcoin fortune? Consider giving away some of it to charity.As 2020 draws to a close, the cryptocurrency has seen a massive surge in appreciation. The value of a single unit of bitcoin is now hovering around $28,000.Though longtime holders of the virtual currency are rejoicing, they run the risk of winding up overweight in bitcoin. That is, the massive run-up in values could suddenly result in investors having more exposure toward bitcoin — and its risks — than they'd like.Similarly, while cashing out of your holdings might seem attractive, it could come with a hefty capital gains tax bill on the appreciation.More from Advisor Insight:How financial advisors say to use your $600 stimulus checkHere's who's likely eligible for a second stimulus checkCovid relief bill adds PPP tax breaks the Treasury opposedThat's where charitable giving comes into play.""We believe in asset diversification, and because the price of bitcoin rose significantly, investors could be overallocated based on their targets for their portfolio,"" said Stefan Podvojsky, senior vice president of Fidelity Charitable.""A donor advised fund provides a great outlet to remove that overweight and support the philanthropy that is important to the donor,"" he said.Indeed, investors in bitcoin have been able to donate their holdings to donor-advised funds via Fidelity Charitable since 2015.Benefactors have given close to $26 million in bitcoin to Fidelity Charitable's donor-advised funds year to date as of Dec. 29.Donor-advised funds are accounts generous investors can fund with a variety of assets and use for making grants to their favorite charitable causes.Nevertheless, giving away bitcoin and other crypto assets can come with a unique set of hurdles, including price volatility and additional tax reporting on the part of the investor.Though you can convert cryptocurrency into dollars, the IRS regards it as property for income tax purposes.This means you're subject to capital gains taxes if you decide to sell or exchange your virtual currency holdings.The magnitude of the tax hit will depend on how long you've held your bitcoin — if it's at least a year, you may qualify for the long-term capital gains rate of 0%, 15% or 20% — and your cost basis in the asset.Investors who snapped up bitcoin when it was especially cheap — consider that one bitcoin was worth $7,220 Dec. 30, 2019 — may face the harshest tax consequences when they sell or exchange it.That's because the tax would be based on the difference between their cost basis and today's market price.Meanwhile, donating an asset you've held for at least a year will allow you to claim a tax deduction based on its fair market value.""Donating it could be incredibly tax-conducive,"" said Bryan Clontz, founder and president of Charitable Solutions, a firm that specializes in receiving and liquidating noncash assets for charities.""It's the holy grail of charitable planning: a low basis, highly appreciated asset,"" he said.Another reason why donating crypto via a donor-advised fund might make sense: Your favorite charity may be skittish about accepting direct contributions of virtual currency due to data security issues.""The big issue for charities is the volatility and the risk that if you set up your own wallet, wallets can be hacked,"" said Greg Sharkey, senior philanthropy advisor at The Nature Conservancy, a charity in Arlington, Virginia.The organization teamed up with BitPay, a bitcoin payment service provider, to accept donations and convert them to cash.""If the donor calls this morning and wants to make gifts and does it through BitPay, the money would be at the charity's account tomorrow,"" said Sharkey.What makes cryptocurrency so complex is the fact that not only are these assets subject to price volatility, but they also trade constantly.Generally, the deduction a donor can claim is based on the price of the asset on the date they relinquish control to the donor-advised fund.Fidelity Charitable only trades bitcoin during New York Stock Exchange market hours, or 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern, on weekdays, said Podvojsky. ""Depending on when during the day you might transfer the bitcoin to us, you would be subject to the price in the market and the liquidity we would be able to obtain at that point in time,"" he said.Investors hoping to claim a tax deduction for their donation have extra legwork.Because they're giving away a special asset, they must obtain a qualified appraisal from a third party and file Form 8283 with the IRS.""Roughly $500 to $600 per appraisal would be the market for this space, and you'd have to have a larger donation to make it worth it,"" said Clontz. ""There's a cost to the donor, and it's not just five minutes of work.""Giving away those appreciated bitcoin holdings and collecting a tax write-off isn't just a one-person effort. Here are a few considerations:Gather your experts: Financial advisors have a bird's eye view of a client's holdings, but they'll likely need to link up with the client's accountant and a qualified appraiser to ensure the investor maximizes his tax deduction for the donation.Consider taking the donor-advised fund route: Volatility and data security are chief concerns for charities, and not all of them are equipped to take direct donations of crypto assets. A donor-advised fund can receive the gift, convert it and allow you to make grants to your favorite charities.Maintain solid records. The IRS has made no secret of its interest in crypto assets. The front page of the 2020 income tax return asks whether you've transacted in virtual currency over the year. Be sure to hold on to any acknowledgement letters you receive from charities, as well as your appraisal documents.Correction: New York Stock Exchange market hours are 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern on weekdays. An earlier version misstated the times."
2021-01-05,The Brexit deal leaves the future uncertain for financial services — here’s what is at stake,0.08202771765271769,"Britain formally left the European Union's trade bloc on Dec. 31, marking a new era for the U.K.-EU relationship.  After months of wrangling, new rules for trade were finally agreed just days before the year-end deadline. But in a document spanning over 1,200 pages, there was very little mention of financial services: a sector which accounts for 7% of the U.K.'s economy and 10% of its tax receipts.  One particular issue that arises is the clearing of euro-denominated derivatives. The size of the European derivatives market topped 680 trillion euros ($834 trillion) in 2019, and the majority of European clearing activity takes place on London-based exchanges such as LCH.So far, the European Securities and Markets Authority has agreed to roll over current clearing arrangements for these derivatives until June 22, giving more time for EU-based institutions to decrease their reliance on the British-based clearers. It has previously said it wants euro-denominated derivative trading to only take place within the EU, or somewhere with ""equivalent"" regulations.The two sides have committed to releasing a memo of understanding within twelve weeks that will give further clarity on these equivalence rules. They are especially important for the financial industry as they enable U.K.-based companies to sell services into Europe, as long as the regulations don't diverge substantially from Brussels.   Douglas Flint, chairman of Standard Life Aberdeen, told CNBC's Squawk Box that there does appear to be ""a general recognition that financial stability is too important to risk by having a clumsy exit.""""There has been a discussion of mutual recognition or equivalence for the last four and a half years, so it would take a fresh approach between the U.K.and EU to agree what is important and how the infrastructure can continue to operate,"" he said on Monday. The current arrangement allows for the EU to withdraw equivalence rights for U.K. institutions with only 30 days' notice, a decision that the U.K. has no right to contest. ""Europe has always been very defensive against external providers, so when the U.K. counts as an external provider it will have to take what it's given,"" Simon Gleeson, partner at Clifford Chance, told CNBC. ""The regulatory response therefore needs to be a cooperative response between national regulators.""  The approach so far has been piecemeal and on a temporary bilateral basis. For instance, Italy on Sunday announced that it is allowing U.K. financial companies to keep operating as they are in the country for another six months.  Leaving it up to each individual regulator to make arrangements has also complicated the setup on the ground. Many U.K-based banks have moved personnel covering the Dutch, French, Spanish and German markets to the continent, while those covering Italian and Scandinavian markets have been able to remain in the U.K.  The loss of ""passporting"" — or the ability to trade freely — post-Brexit also means that the days of financial advisors being able to fly in and out of Europe to operate have come to an end. This has prompted many senior staff to relocate to other European hubs such Frankfurt and Paris, the latter being attractive because of the prospect of lower income taxes. In October, EY estimated that the total number of financial services jobs to have left the country since the Brexit referendum was just over 7,500, an estimate that falls short of the gloomy scenario of hundreds of thousands that was forecast by some think tanks in 2016.  As for bank preparedness, NatWest Chairman Howard Davies told CNBC's Street Signs on Monday that while U.K.-focused banks were largely prepared for a ""hard"" Brexit by setting up subsidiaries on the continent, ""what we can't prepare for is the uncertainty which persists."" ""At the moment we don't know what the future arrangement or the regulation of cross border entities in Europe will be. So there is a limit to what financial institutions can do when there are still very significant moving parts here,"" he added. Long term, industry players are still positive on London's fortunes as a global financial hub, with one hedge fund manager telling CNBC that he would still be willing to back the U.K. as ""our business is largely immune to the changes and most aspects of the City are very reliant on talent, knowledge and relationships and for a lot of reasons this is embedded in the U.K."" Natwest's Davies echoes this view, saying London will remain the largest financial center in Europe for the foreseeable future, but the extent that it can ""retain intra-EU business will depend on the new arrangements on regulatory cooperation and equivalence."" Former trade minister and Senior Advisor at Covington, Francis Maude, agreed. ""London is not just a European financial center but a global center. I hope this will be dealt with in a pragmatic way with regulators operating in a non-political"", he told CNBC last week, concluding that, ""this is not the end of a story, it's the beginning of a different story."""

T-Mobile reported 60 cents in earnings per share and $20.34 billion in revenue. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had penciled in 51 cents per share and $19.93 billion in revenue. The company's guidance for cash flow metrics in 2021 missed expectations, however, according to FactSet.Peloton — Shares of the at-home cycling stock fell more than 7% after the company outlined ongoing supply chain issues amid a surge in demand for its products.

2021-02-11,Traders on which travel stock they’re backing as Expedia reports earnings,0.05028579445246113,"Expedia fell in extended trading Thursday after its quarterly release.The online travel booking site posted a 67% drop in revenue to $920 million in the three months to December, below analysts' estimates for more than $1 billion. A loss of $2.64 a share was wider than an expected $1.94.The company blazed into its earnings in comeback mode, though. The stock had rallied 268% from its March low, hitting its highest level since 2017 on Thursday, even with the travel industry still struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic.But, that performance still pales in comparison to Airbnb. Since going public on Dec. 10, that stock has surged more than 200%. Airbnb's market cap of $130 billion is larger than all the other online travel booking sites including Expedia, Booking and TripAdvisor.Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies, broke down the Airbnb chart for CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Thursday.""It's in an intermediate-term uptrend already just with history back to December, and with limited price history we don't really have any ways to discern how overbought the stock is, but there are no real signs of upside exhaustion as we come into [Airbnb] earnings,"" she said.Airbnb is scheduled to report earnings on Feb. 25 for the first time as a publicly traded company. While Airbnb has benefited from a consumer preference for vacation rentals over hotel chains during the pandemic, it has still suffered from lockdowns – analysts surveyed by FactSet anticipate a net loss of $8.42 a share for its December-ended quarter.""If you look at Expedia on the other hand, that uptrend still very much has positive momentum across time horizons and I'm not really one to fight that. But what I would say is that the risk reward is not great from a technical perspective,"" Stockton said.She highlights a band of support at $135 and resistance at $161, level with its 2017 high. The stock closed at $149.91 on Thursday.""That creates a bad imbalance between the downside and upside potential here in terms of those levels so I don't think it's very compelling especially with the broader market showing some signs of short-term upside exhaustion,"" she said.Expedia's next stock move depends on how well its investments in its vacation rental brand Vrbo have paid off, according to Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management.""The market is really betting on a very, very specific type of travel which is that when we are released from the pandemic, most of us are going to go either to the beach or to the lake. We're not going to go to the cultural centers, the cities, the museums, the restaurants, the theaters. ...

2021-03-15,"Stripe raises new capital, reaching $95 billion valuation ahead of highly anticipated market debut",0.10826311899482632,"Online payments technology provider Stripe announced Sunday that it has raised a new $600 million round of funding that values the company at $95 billion — nearly triple its last reported valuation of $36 billion from April 2020, according to PitchBook data.Stripe, which makes software that allows businesses to accept payments over the internet, intends to invest the new capital into its European operations, the company said in a release. Thirty-one of the 42 countries that Stripe operates in are located in Europe, and President and Co-Founder John Collison singled out Ireland — where the company is headquartered — as a particular area of focus.Founded more than a decade ago, today Stripe is by far the most valuable private fintech company, with Robinhood trailing at a roughly $11.7 billion valuation after investors wrote the company a $3 billion check amid this year's GameStop chaos.Stripe has seen eye-popping growth during the pandemic as its revenue is largely tied to growth in online shopping. In its previous funding round last April, Stripe was early to highlight the Covid-19 outbreak as ""pushing the economy online"" and said ""several years of offline-to-online migration are being compressed into several weeks.""""We're investing in the infrastructure that will power internet commerce in 2030 and beyond,"" wrote chief financial officer Dhivya Suryadevara, who joined the company in August after moving out of her role as General Motors' CFO. ""The pandemic taught us many things about society, including how much can be achieved — and paid for — online, but the internet still isn't the engine for global economic progress that it could be.""In December, the company launched banking services through partnerships with Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Barclays and Evolve Bank & Trust.But despite its ballooning growth and valuation, the company has stayed tight-lipped about the prospect of a Wall Street debut, as John Collison told CNBC last year that the company has ""no plans"" to go public right away. Primary investors in the new series H round include Allianz, Fidelity, Sequoia Capital and Ireland's National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA). Previous investors include Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Alphabet's late-stage investing arm, Capital G, among others.Earlier this year, Stripe invested $102 million in a Series B round for Fast — a smaller online checkout company based in San Francisco. Stripe, which also led the start-up's Series A, is the underlying payments rails for Fast's checkout product.Stripe is a six-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company and landed at the top spot on the list in 2020.Correction: The first paragraph of this story has been updated to reflect that Stripe's latest valuation is $95 billion."
2021-03-15,DigitalOcean emphasizes simplicity in IPO filing as it prepares to battle cloud giants like Amazon,0.06997406329302881,"The market for cloud-computing infrastructure to power applications has grown immensely since Amazon introduced its first cloud services in 2006, but U.S. investors haven't had a great way of investing exclusively in cloud. That will change in the coming weeks when a company called DigitalOcean starts trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""DOCN.""Buying shares of Amazon -- or Alibaba, Google, IBM, Microsoft or Oracle -- has meant getting a small percentage of exposure to the public cloud. DigitalOcean is different because it doesn't do anything else.The company will start out with a much lower valuation than those other companies. In a Monday update to the prospectus for its initial public offering, DigitalOcean said it expects to sell shares at $44 to $47 per share, which would give it a market cap of about $4.8 billion at the middle of the range. DigitalOcean also said Tiger Global and an entity tied to existing investor Access Industries want to buy up to $175 million in the company's shares at the time of the IPO.Unlike public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services, DigitalOcean is not profitable. It lost almost $44 million in 2020, compared with a $40 million loss in 2019. DigitalOcean is also growing more slowly than AWS, despite that AWS generates 142 times more revenue. AWS revenue in 2020 totaled $45.37 billion, up 29.5%, while DigitalOcean reported 25% revenue growth.That might be okay, because DigitalOcean has a specialty: Simplicity. It isn't overwhelming to new users, who wind up increasing the amount they spend on DigitalOcean services over time.Simplicity is one of the four principles the founders picked when DigitalOcean started in 2012. ""We take infrastructure technology and make it simple across all aspects of the product experience,"" CEO Yancey Spruill, a former operating chief and finance chief at SendGrid, wrote in a letter to investors in the prospectus.Since 2006 AWS has introduced a wide swath of services for software developers to adopt, and its customer list has gotten long, with big names like Apple paying hundreds of millions per year.That's not DigitalOcean's path. It has just a handful of products, including customizable Linux-based virtual machines that it calls droplets, data-storage options, networking tools and three databases. Unlike on Amazon, there are no machine-learning services, deployment tools, database-migration technologies or media-transcoding systems. It maintains 6,000 tutorials designed to help people get going.DigitalOcean also tries to stay simple with pricing and the bills it sends each month to its nearly 600,000 customers. DigitalOcean took a swipe at the big public-cloud vendors in its prospectus, saying their products aren't intuitive enough for sole developers and small businesses and ""suffer from near-infinite feature complexity and have opaque pricing and billing practices that are often accompanied by significant hidden costs."" As a result, the company said, small businesses are often unable to enjoy the benefits of cloud computing.""Companies frequently need dedicated employees, pricing analytics tools or even specialized consultants to understand how products are priced and how to manage their bills,"" it wrote. If DigitalOcean has found a sweet spot, it's with small businesses, rather than large enterprises, which the big clouds have been fighting over in the past few years. It's a self-service business that doesn't rely heavily on a large group of salespeople. In that way it will be like website-building company Wix and e-commerce software maker Shopify.The New York-based company also has foreign reach. Rather than touting S&P 500 clients in its prospectus, DigitalOcean showcases customers such as Bunnyshell of Romania, Cloudways of Malta, Jiji of Nigeria, Vidazoo of Israel and Whatfix of India. In 2020 38% of DigitalOcean's revenue came from North America; by comparison, 68% of Amazon's 2020 revenue came from the U.S.DigitalOcean has yet to take major share in the cloud infrastructure market, though, and some of its customers could end up switching to more comprehensive cloud providers as their needs evolve.But DigitalOcean is hopeful. In the prospectus the company said it expects more than 14 million small and medium-size businesses to be formed each year, and their founders don't necessarily come with sharp technical skills. ""These individuals are able to leverage simple and reliable development tools and the widespread availability and significantly lower upfront cost of cloud computing to start companies,"" the company said.WATCH: Bessemer's Byron Deeter on the resurgence of cloud computing stocks"
2021-03-30,Crypto investor who bought Beeple's NFT for $69 million says he would have paid even more,0.21396825396825397,"The buyer of the $69 million NFT by the artist Beeple said he was prepared to bid even higher, since it will be seen by history as the starting point of a new age of digital art.In his first television interview, Vignesh Sundaresan, also known as MetaKovan, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that he has no regrets paying $69 million for what many say is simply a JPEG and an hyperlink. He said the rise of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, herald a new era where technology has allowed artists and collectors around the world to buy and sell art more easily and democratically.""This NFT is a significant piece of art history,"" Sundaresan said. ""Sometimes these things take some time for everyone to recognize and realize. I'm OK with that. I had the opportunity to be part of this very important shift in how art has been perceived for centuries.""NFTs have exploded in recent months, as NBA video highlights, memes, digital art and even a tweet sell for six or seven figures. While proponents say NFTs, which assign ownership of any digital asset on the blockchain, will not only change the art world but could be applied to physical goods like homes and property. Sales of NFTs have now topped $500 million, according to many estimates.""There are going to be hundreds of thousands of people from around the world who are going to adopt this medium, a digitally native medium to monetize art,"" Sundaresan said. ""There is going to be an economy around it. ""He said that while the art world has been the exclusive purview of wealthy, largely white Western collectors and artists for centuries, NFTs have allowed ""artists in the Philippines, Thailand, or India now to make their first $1,000 or $500 on the internet.""Sundaresan declined to say exactly how much he was prepared to pay for the work. He said he knew going into the Christie's auction that ""it would be competitive"" and had a ceiling price in mind that was higher than the $69.3 million he paid.""We did have a higher limit,"" he said. ""I was very motivated and ready to go beyond even what we paid for it.""Sundaresan said he has been investing in cryptocurrencies and cryptocompanies since 2013. He said he started ""with no money"" and began working for cryptocompanies and was able to invest early in fast-growth companies that have grown up around the cryptoeconomy. He declined to say how much he's worth on paper ""since it depends on the cryptomarket.""He said he has invested in not just bitcoin and Ethereum, but also blockchain network Polka Dot and Flow. He said he's doesn't think crypto will face a ban from regulators or central banks.""If regulators were tighter in previous years, that would have stifled innovation. I think we're at a point where they see the positive impacts of crypto around the world.""When asked what his $69 million Beeple could be worth in a year or even 10 years, Sundaresan said he had no plans to sell it. But he hinted he may find ways to ""monetize it"" by either offering pieces of it or displaying it in a virtual museum.""The piece is going to take on a life of its own, that's what makes NFTs really interesting,"" he said. ""It may not just be a piece of art, it can become thousands of other things. But I won't be selling it anytime soon."""
2021-04-19,Britain intervenes in Nvidia's $40 billion Arm takeover on national security concerns,0.125682237117721,"LONDON — The U.K. government has intervened in Nvidia's proposed $40 billion takeover of chip designer Arm on national security grounds.Britain's Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden issued a Public Interest Intervention Notice (PIIN) on Monday. It's not clear what the national security grounds are but the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said Dowden ""considered advice received from officials across the investment security community.""Dowden said he has written to the U.K. competition watchdog and asked them to start a ""phase one"" investigation into the transaction, which was announced in September.The Competition and Markets Authority has been instructed to compile a report for Dowden on the competition and national security aspects of the deal before July 30. Dowden could then approve the deal, permit it on certain conditions, or ask for a more detailed inquiry.""Following careful consideration of the proposed takeover of Arm, I have today issued an intervention notice on national security grounds,"" said Dowden in a statement. ""As a next step and to help me gather the relevant information, the U.K.'s independent competition authority will now prepare a report on the implications of the transaction, which will help inform any further decisions.""He added: ""We want to support our thriving UK tech industry and welcome foreign investment, but it is appropriate that we properly consider the national security implications of a transaction like this."" A spokesperson for Nvidia said: ""We do not believe that this transaction poses any material national security issues. We will continue to work closely with the British authorities, as we have done since the announcement of this deal.""Arm is being sold by SoftBank, which acquired the firm for £24 billion ($33 billion) in 2016 without any major issues. The new sale, however, has raised concerns that Nvidia could relocate Arm's headquarters to the U.S. and reduce competition in the semiconductor industry.The ongoing global chip shortage has also highlighted how important semiconductors are in today's world. They're used in everything from smartphones and cars to fighter jets and other weapons systems. As a result, nations are keen to become more self-reliant when it comes to chip production, which is currently dominated by China.Set up in the 1980s, Arm licenses its chip designs to manufacturers around the world and it's been referred to as the ""Switzerland"" of the chip industry due to its neutrality. Chipmakers including Qualcomm have expressed concerns that Nvidia may look to close off access to Arm's technology, but Nvidia insists that such a move isn't planned.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has pledged to keep Arm's headquarters in Cambridge and expand the company's footprint in the city.The deal is also being probed by regulators in the U.S., China and the European Union and some question whether it will be allowed to go through. Five industry sources, including two tech investors, told CNBC in February that they think the deal has a very high chance of being blocked by one or more of the regulators."
2021-05-12,"CDC says 28 blood clot cases, 3 deaths may be linked to J&J Covid vaccine",0.11666666666666667,"CDC scientists say their investigation into a rare blood clotting issue linked to the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine has identified 28 people who developed the potentially life threatening blockages — three of whom have died.The Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on April 13 asked states to temporarily halt using J&J's vaccine ""out of an abundance of caution"" while it investigated six women, ages 18 to 48, who developed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or CVST, in combination with low blood platelets within about two weeks of receiving the shot.They recommended resuming use of the shot 10 days later after the CDC determined that the benefits of the inoculations outweighed their risks.CVST is a form of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or TTS, which are blood clots with a low platelet count that puts patients at risk for a stroke. Platelets actually help the blood to clot.CDC official Dr. Tom Shimabukuro said Wednesday that four of the 28 people with TTS remained in the hospital as of May 7, one of whom was in the ICU, and two have been discharged to a post-acute care facility. The remaining 19 patients have all been discharged, he said during a presentation to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

""We expect distributed solar installations to continue growing robustly, especially now that energy storage is becoming economically viable.""Following a 140% gain in 2020, the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF has dipped 20% this year. The S&P 500, by comparison, has gained 12%.Guggenheim pointed to several possible factors driving the declines, including excessive valuations after 2020's record run, as well as slower-than-expected governmental policies. Other concerns include rising input costs, such as for steel and semiconductors, and higher interest rates.But given solar's large and growing market, Guggenheim said the pullback is an ""attractive opportunity"" to pick up shares of quality names."
2021-07-27,"CDC reverses indoor mask policy, saying fully vaccinated people and kids should wear them indoors",0.11987052581564776,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Tuesday that fully vaccinated people begin wearing masks indoors again in places with high Covid-19 transmission rates. The agency is also recommending kids wear masks in schools this fall.Federal health officials still believe fully vaccinated individuals represent a very small amount of transmission. Still, some vaccinated people could be carrying higher levels of the virus than previously understood and potentially transmit it to others.""This pandemic continues to pose a serious threat to the health of all Americans,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters on a call. ""Today, we have new science related to the delta variant that requires us to update the guidance regarding what you can do when you are fully vaccinated.""The updated guidance comes ahead of the fall season, when the highly contagious delta variant is expected to cause another surge in new coronavirus cases and many large employers plan to bring workers back to the office. In mid-May, the CDC said fully vaccinated people didn't need to wear masks in most settings, whether indoors or outdoors.""In areas with substantial and high transmission, CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public, indoor settings to help prevent the spread of the delta variant, and protect others. This includes schools,"" Walensky said. The CDC recommends that everyone in grade schools wear masks indoors, ""including teachers, staff, students and visitors, regardless of vaccination status.""Walensky said new data shows the variant behaves ""uniquely differently from past strains of the virus,"" indicating that some vaccinated people infected with the delta variant ""may be contagious and spread the virus to others.""Read More: Americans will need masks indoors as U.S. heads for 'dangerous fall' with surge in delta Covid casesHealth experts fear delta, already the dominant form of the disease in the U.S., is hitting states with low vaccination rates. Those states are now being forced to reintroduce mask rules, capacity limits and other public health measures that they've largely rolled back in recent months.White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that the CDC was considering whether to revise mask guidance for vaccinated Americans, saying it was ""under active consideration.""""It's a dynamic situation. It's a work in progress, it evolves like in so many other areas of the pandemic,"" Fauci, also the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN.

But even before the CDC's anticipated guidance Tuesday, some regions were reintroducing mask mandates and advisories as Covid cases began to spike again.Walensky said a majority of the hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. are occurring among unvaccinated people, pointing to vaccines she said worked well in protecting against severe illness and death. ""But the big concern is that the next variant that might emerge, we're just a few mutations potentially away where it could potentially evade our vaccines,"" she said.President Joe Biden said the CDC's updated guidance was necessary to defeat the virus, and that he will lay out ""next steps"" to get more Americans vaccinated on Thursday.""Although most U.S. adults are vaccinated, too many are not. While we have seen an increase in vaccinations in recent days, we still need to do better,"" he said in a statement. ""More vaccinations and mask wearing in the areas most impacted by the Delta variant will enable us to avoid the kind of lockdowns, shutdowns, school closures, and disruptions we faced in 2020.""Several counties across California and Nevada were already advising all residents to wear masks in public indoor settings — whether they are vaccinated or not. In Massachusetts, officials in Provincetown advised all individuals to resume wearing masks indoors after Fourth of July celebrations led to an outbreak of new cases.Experts say Covid prevention strategies remain critical to protect people from the virus, especially in areas of moderate-to-high community transmission levels.The CDC defines ""substantial transmission"" as counties that have 50 to 100 cases per 100,000 residents over a seven-day period and ""high transmission"" is more than 100 cases per 100,000 people over seven days, Walensky said.""We have places and counties and states here that are now reporting over 300 cases per 100,000 over a seven day period.

While the vaccines protect well against severe disease and death, they may not protect as well against mild disease or spreading Covid to others, he said. No vaccine is 100% effective, he noted.""It is not a bold prediction to believe that SARS-CoV-2 is going to be circulating two or three years from now. I mean there are 195 countries out there, most of which haven't been given a single dose of vaccine,"" Offit said. ""Will it still be circulating in the United States? I think that would be very, very likely.""Israel released preliminary data last week that showed the Pfizer vaccine is just 39% effective against the virus there, which officials attributed to the rapidly spreading delta variant. Its effectiveness against severe disease and death remained high, the data showed. U.S. and world health officials said they are looking at the Israeli research, which was not peer-reviewed and was scant on details.Executives from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have said they expect Americans will need booster shots, and Pfizer has said it plans to ask the FDA to authorize boosters as it sees signs of waning immunity. Federal health officials say booster doses of the vaccines are not needed for otherwise healthy people at this time, although they may recommend it for the elderly or people with compromised immunity.– CNBC's Meg Tirrell and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
2021-08-01,Why Apple shareholders shouldn't be too worried after the earnings selloff,0.11361366196527485,"If you are an Apple shareholder who wondered after last week's stellar earnings report why the value of your stock holding was going down rather than up, the reason given — that chip shortages will weigh on the short-term outlook — may not seem good enough. For a trader looking at every short-term opportunity to move portfolio money to where the next quick buck is likely to be, it doesn't take more than that ""sell on the news"" headline. Longer-term investors, though, might want to consider a recent fact about the company and negative headlines: Apple has overcome pretty much every short-term ""sell"" headline in recent years on its way to being a $2-trillion-plus company.Trump's trade war with China? No problem. The surprise decision to stop offering iPhone unit guidance? Much ado about nothing as the iPhone super-cycle came along anyway. As for the global semiconductor chip shortage now being cited by Apple, it might be wise to keep in mind that Apple has a long history of being pretty conservative with its outlook — formal earnings guidance still has not returned. And one more thing: Tim Cook was elevated to the CEO post after Steve Jobs based on his mastery of global logistics.""Let's face it, if Apple has any trouble getting chips, then every other company on the planet will have 10x those problems,"" said Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. ""If you're really worried about chip supply, you want to own Apple because it is first in line at every chip fab.""But there is a bigger question relevant to Apple and the rest of the market: Just how strong is the next leg of growth for the market going to be?The immediate outlook for the market doesn't necessarily scream buy-on-the-dip after the big tech sell-on-the-news, according to Colas. Seasonality is an immediate risk, with market history showing the early August period to be a volatile one for the VIX volatility index.""It's a valid trading question, where to go for the trading dollar in August,"" Colas said.Since 1990, the early August period has been one into which the VIX peaks. Part of the reason is the lighter volumes in the market during the summer. ""It's a trough for liquidity, when people are on vacation ... a lower number of people trading and more volatility any news item will carry. I am telling clients to be careful,"" he said.On Wednesday through Friday of last week, the S&P 500 trading volume was below its 30-day average.For the short-term trader, a rotation away from the large-cap leaders into small-cap represented by the Russell 2000, which Colas described as being ""way oversold"" since its torrid hot streak in early 2021, could make sense. ""Small-caps went parabolic through March and April and have not worked since because they got so far ahead,"" he said.That makes them, at least statistically, based on 100-day trailing returns, cheap right now.But for investors not playing the market for a quick trade, Colas says the post-earnings disappointing trades from Apple, Facebook and Microsoft shouldn't weigh too heavily. Amazon was the outlier in actually missing revenue expectations rather than posting a big beat, making a selloff on the news a ""fair"" reaction, according to Colas.It's also important to remember that the big beats from the rest of big tech were already embedded in most of the stocks as they had a strong June and July based on the market guessing right — that Q2 earnings would be stellar. ""The market was bidding up the names into the quarter. The market sniffed out the surprise and they all occurred, and when you see stocks all rally into a quarterly earnings, it's just hard to sustain that. That is 'sell on the news' unless there is a tremendous amount of good news and guidance,"" Colas said. ""That's normal capital markets behavior.""He goes back to one important data point in assessing the strength of these companies: they have doubled their earnings power in the past two years. ""Which is astounding,"" he said. And that gives him more comfort in the longer-term picture. ""I don't see any change. Big tech is still the place to be.""He cited two reasons.Even as these companies have doubled earnings growth, he doesn't think they are anywhere near peak earnings. ""It's just a much higher base to build on.""Second, these companies have definitive advantages in industries and don't directly compete against each other in a zero-sum game i many areas of strength.These companies have grown earnings so much because the pandemic changed consumption patterns, made us all even more tech-centric, and the market made a lot of money betting on that playing out exactly as it did. But now the big question for big tech isn't about its dominance being threatened — though multiple antitrust battles loom — it is just figuring out how much more room they have to keep the earnings growth rate going higher.""Tell me what you would pay for a company with a 30% return on investment and structural growth of 10% to 15%, and can do it for a decade? What is the multiple? Is it 30 times or 40 times? I have no idea,"" Colas said, ""but I know it's not 20 times.""Apple was an example from this group of concerns about price-to-earnings multiples. It lagged the rest of the tech giants for years, seen as a hardware vendor and weighed down by that market view until the services business soared through the pandemic and the $2 trillion market cap was given to the company. And again this year, it was ""the one oddball laggard,"" in Colas's words, as its year-to-date return into earnings was roughly 10% versus roughly 30% for Facebook and Microsoft.Apple trailed the S&P 500, too, ahead of the earnings. One reason: it sucked so much demand forward investors are rightly concerned posting good earnings comps will get harder. But, Colas said, that might also mean it has the most room left to go up, even in the short-term as a new iPhone launches in the fall and back-to-school boosts spending on consumer tech.The broader global growth story the entire stock market is tied to isn't a lock. In fact, amid the panic over inflation earlier this year and expectations that the 10-year Treasury yield would go higher, it did the opposite. ""The market totally understood growth had peaked in Q1 and started trending down at the end of the quarter,"" Colas said.The rate story was wrong, but slower economic growth is now higher up on the list of investor concerns for a U.S. market where P/E ratios are high. Big tech represents 23% of S&P 500 and that means whatever the market next decides about its lofty valuations will weigh on U.S. stocks overall.But investors don't have that many great choices globally. With the situation in China between the government and its leading companies resulting in massive losses in recent weeks, there might be trading opportunities, but emerging markets are no place to be for anything but a trade. And even if there is potential opportunity in other international plays like European financials, it is going to take time for rates to move in a direction that benefits those stocks.""What's left? It's U.S. and the top of the cap table,"" Colas said. ""That's what you need to own. Still back to the same names.""Looking at sector weightings back to the 1970s and through the 1990s, he says there has never been a time when five companies had more weighting. ""It's just 5 names, and it's not like when Exxon was at its peak in the S&P. That was a commodity play. These companies have huge barriers to entry and very high structural returns.""Even with those advantages, trying to figure out what their earnings power will be post-pandemic, or at least as the world transitions from the worst of the pandemic to the lingering effects, is the bigger issue for big tech.""What is a fair growth rate for 2022? That is hard,"" Colas said.For Alphabet — the only among the big tech names to report last week which rose after its earnings — and for Facebook, which reiterated a prior warning of slowing revenue growth, there is the cyclical nature of advertising market to rely on, and that has not changed all that much in recent decades. Apple, though, is a harder one, because even as it has made progress moving past the iPhone story and building its services business into a huge driver of growth, so much hardware demand was pulled forward.For Amazon, Colas noted that e-commerce's share of demand when from 17% to 24% in Q2 2020, and then back down to 20%. And every percentage point in that band has huge leverage over Amazon's business model  — in fact, he pointed to it as a reason why Amazon had been ""stuck in that band"" for nine months before it rallied into earnings. From October 2020 to June of this year Amazon had bounced around but didn't get bid up like the other names until the pre-earnings run. Year-to-date after its earnings fall, the stock is barely holding onto a gain, just under 3%.What just occurred in all of these stocks was a peaking into earnings, but it's nowhere near peak earnings for these companies, Colas said. The concept of peak earnings, which has been a concern for investors, implies there is a point in the cycle when a company shows its highest earnings growth in absolute terms. ""That's what peak earnings are about, and no big tech company is near peak earnings on an absolute basis,"" Colas said. ""Because they continue to grow and their amount of earnings leverage is massive.""That is more likely to be a buy on the future after the sell on the news has worn off."
2021-08-19,"Jim Cramer says Chevron looks attractive thanks to its dividend, but oil could fall further",0.032439967439967445,"Investors who want to buy an energy stock as the price of oil slides should look to Chevron, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday.""Here's a stock that everyone seemed to just be gaga about a few weeks ago, and now it can't get any love,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said of Chevron. ""The stock's fallen from $113 to $94, but at these levels it sports a 5.7% yield. I like Chevron very much.""An attractive dividend is the primary reason to consider owning an oil stock right now, Cramer suggested.Outside of Chevron, Cramer said two other oil plays that carry slightly more risk are Devon and Pioneer Natural Resources. While both companies have solid variable dividends, he stressed that ""their payouts could shrink as oil comes down.""The price of crude slid in recent weeks and on Thursday closed in the red for the sixth-straight session, touching its lowest level since May.The U.S. oil benchmark, West Texas Intermediate crude futures, dropped 2.7% to settle at $63.69 per barrel. Brent crude, which is the international benchmark, declined about 2% to just under $67 per barrel.After a red-hot start to the year, oil has faced weakness due, in part, to concerns about slowing demand as the coronavirus pandemic persists around the world. Comments this week about a potential change to the Federal Reserve's highly accommodative monetary policy also caused the U.S. dollar to strengthen. That can end up hurting oil because it makes crude more costly for overseas buyers.In July, as WTI traded above $72 per barrel, Cramer said he believed oil had put in its near-term top. He said Thursday more weakness could be ahead, as an increase in supply clashes with a slump in demand. Investors who are looking to buy an oil stock need to be mindful of that, Cramer said.""Be careful, because oil ... may not be done rolling over yet,"" he said. ""I don't know if oil can even hold above $60 these days. Most American producers are still plenty profitable above $60, but below that level, it does start to get more dicey.""Questions for Cramer?

2021-08-29,'Powerful and dangerous' Hurricane Ida is on the verge of landfall in Louisiana ,0.05623597081930415,"Hurricane Ida was on the verge of making landfall in the United States on Sunday as an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm that could plunge much of the Louisiana shoreline underwater as the state grapples with a Covid-19 surge already taxing hospitals.Ida gathered more strength overnight, faster than meteorologists had predicted only a day ago. It is the toughest test yet for the hundreds of miles of new levees built around New Orleans after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, which made landfall 16 years ago to the day, inundating historically Black neighborhoods and killing more than 1,800 people.Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that the storm, due to make landfall by Sunday afternoon, could be the state's worst direct hit by a hurricane since the 1850s.The state is also dealing with the nation's third-highest rate of new COVID-19 infections, with about 3,400 new cases reported on Friday alone. Hospitals were treating some 2,450 COVID-19 patients, Edwards said, with those in many of the state's parishes already nearing capacity.By early Sunday, Ida was a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. At 11 a.m. CDT (1600 GMT) it was located about 60 miles (95 km) west-southwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River, and some 85 miles (135 km) south of New Orleans, carrying top sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).Rain gusted through New Orleans on Sunday morning, where retired 68-year-old Robert Ruffin had evacuated with his family to a downtown hotel from their home in the city's east.""I thought it was safer,"" he said. ""It's double trouble this time because of COVID.""IDA's landfall was only a few hours away, according to the NHC, which warned of life-threatening storm surges, potentially catastrophic wind damage and flooding rainfall.""We're as prepared as we can be, but we're worried about those levees,"" said Kirk Lepine, president of Plaquemines Parish on the state's Gulf Coast.Plaquemines is one of the most vulnerable parishes, where 23,000 people live along the Mississippi delta stretching into the Gulf. Lepine feared levees along Highway 23 were not up to task.""Water could go over top,"" he said. ""That's our one road in and out.""Edwards told CNN on Sunday that he believed the state's levees would be able to withstand the storm surge, though he expressed some doubt about parishes, like Plaquemines, in the south.""Where we're less confident is further south where you have other protection systems that are not built to that same standard,"" he said. ""That's where we are most concerned about the impact of storm surge.""He said on Saturday there were no plans to evacuate patients from hospitals, and that state officials had been speaking with hospitals to ensure their generators were working and that they had more water on hand than normal.Officials ordered widespread evacuations of low-lying and coastal areas, jamming highways and leading some gasoline stations to run dry as residents and vacationers fled.""This is a powerful and dangerous storm. It is moving faster than we had thought it would be, so we have a little less time to prepare,"" said Dr. Joseph Kanter, Louisiana's chief medical official. ""There is a lot of Covid out there, there are a lot of risks out there.""Utilities were bringing in extra crews and equipment to deal with expected power losses. U.S. President Joe Biden said he has coordinated with electric utilities and 500 federal emergency response workers were in Texas and Louisiana to respond to the storm.U.S. energy companies reduced offshore oil production by 91% and gasoline refiners cut operations at Louisiana plants in the path of the storm. Regional fuel prices rose in anticipation of production losses and on increased demand due to evacuations.Coastal and inland oil refineries also began to cut production due to the storm. Phillips 66 shut its Alliance plant on the coast in Belle Chasse, while Exxon Mobil cut production at its Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery on Saturday.Jean Paul Bourg, 39, was planning to ride out the storm in Morgan City, about 70 miles (112 km) west of New Orleans. His wife's brother was recently released from the hospital after contracting COVID-19 and secured a generator to ensure access to oxygen if needed.""You can't necessarily pile in with family members during Covid,"" Bourg said, after trimming trees and putting up plywood on his house. ""More people than you'd think are sticking around."""

2021-10-18,"Gas crisis, labor shortages and supply chain chaos: Post-Brexit Britain faces a difficult winter",0.08337856173677069,"The U.K. has emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic to find itself faced with an onslaught of new economic crises that have left the country in ""a precarious position,"" experts have warned.A perfect storm of labor shortages, skyrocketing natural gas prices and global supply chain constraints have put the country in prime position for a difficult winter. Rising demand as economies reopen has created similar problems all over the world, but economists argue that Brexit has exacerbated these issues for Britain.A lack of workers is affecting a slew of industries across the country.Britain has an estimated shortage of 100,000 truck drivers, which haulage organizations have largely attributed to a post-Brexit exodus of EU nationals. The lack of truck drivers has disrupted deliveries, leading to empty store shelves, backlogs at ports and dry gas stations, which sparked a panic buying frenzy in September that lasted weeks.Other sectors have also warned of deepening labor shortages that are expected to damage the availability and price of goods in the runup to Christmas.Britain's National Pig Association has warned that up to 120,000 pigs face being culled within weeks because of a lack of butchers and abattoir workers.In a statement on Friday, the vice president of the U.K.'s National Union of Farmers said labor shortages across the food supply chain remained acute, while the CEO of the U.K. Warehousing Association said in September that industries including warehousing, engineering and transport were all experiencing severe worker shortages.At the end of September, the Confederation of British Industry — which represents 190,000 businesses — said its latest data showed 70% of companies were planning pay rises in a bid to tackle labor shortages.The U.K. government has issued thousands of temporary visas for truck drivers, butchers and agricultural workers, but some critics have argued that this is insufficient to lure foreign workers.Riccardo Crescenzi, a professor of economic geography at the London School of Economics, expressed some skepticism about the solutions being offered by the government.""Offering three-month [visas] might not work while the rest of the EU is booming because of the injection of resources allowed for its recovery plan,"" he told CNBC in a phone call. ""And there is not really an unemployment problem in the U.K., so I struggle to see where drivers would come from in the domestic economy.""Crescenzi said it was hard to know if the issues were temporary. ""Some of these shortages could become structural, and this is a problem that can seriously constrain future growth.""Sam Roscoe, senior associate professor in operations and supply chain management at the University of Sussex, warned that shortages would persist in the U.K. unless there were fundamental changes to the country's immigration system.""Brexit was sold as a vote on immigration independence, the U.K. labor market and making sure that everybody in the U.K. had jobs to go to, but the issue is we have 5% unemployment,"" he said via telephone. ""We've lost access to 27 member countries and the labor pool that was once available there, especially in terms of so-called low-skilled labor. I think that definitely puts us in a precarious position.""Roscoe said it would take years to get enough Brits trained and licensed to drive heavy goods vehicles. ""In the meantime, the reality is we're going to have labor shortages unless the visa rules change.""In a note on Thursday, Credit Suisse economists warned that U.K. consumers ""face headwinds in the next few months,"" including elevated inflation, supply shortages and the tightening of monetary policy.""We think real disposable incomes for the U.K. consumer can fall by about 1.5% in 2022, the biggest fall since 2011,"" the note's authors predicted.Helen Dickinson, head of the British Retail Consortium, told ITV News Thursday that three in five CEOs said they would have to raise prices by the end of the year due to supply chain problems. Some 10% said they had already done so.Charalambos Pissouros, head of research at JFD Group, said he believed panic buying and supply shortages in the U.K. might also impact spending power by damaging sterling's value.""I see the risk surrounding the future of the British pound as tilted to the downside,"" he told CNBC. ""How severe any further tumble may be depends on how long the situation stays unresolved. Quick responses like the involvement of the British military could restore economic performance sooner than thought and halt sterling's fall, and this could also allow the Bank of England to proceed freely with its tightening plans.""It comes as Britain also faces an energy crisis. Several U.K. energy suppliers have collapsed since September as wholesale gas prices climbed to record highs. While the problem has affected markets worldwide, the U.K. is particularly vulnerable because of its reliance on gas; more than 22 million households are connected to the British gas grid.Meanwhile in Europe — which is also battling rising prices — the European Commission on Wednesday published a ""toolbox"" that member states could use ""to address the immediate impact of current [gas] price increases, and further strengthen resilience against future shocks.""Crescenzi told CNBC that the EU can count on the strength of its single market, ""which means global shocks like the gas price crisis can be dealt with more effectively with significantly more room for manoeuvre.""""Following Brexit, the U.K. could still coordinate its response to the crisis with its most important trade and investment partner to ensure the best possible protection for its firms and citizens,"" he added. ""However, measures put out by the U.K. government remain unclear, let alone a strategy to coordinate with external partners. This is alarming.""EU-U.K. relations have been under strain in recent weeks amid disputes over the Northern Ireland protocol, a special trade deal introduced to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Officials have publicly argued on Twitter over the proposals — dubbed the ""biggest source of mistrust"" between both sides by U.K. Brexit Minister David Frost — and met to discuss proposed changes in Brussels on Friday."
